The setting is like a dorm roommate/share set up. You have one side of the room and I got the other side.

The metro is directly on the side of the apartment so you are mins away from downtown and other popular areas.

Great room. Awesome location.

I believe in humanity and by helping each other reach our personal goals, together working as one unit, we, Human beings of Light will accomplish all and build our utopia together. Thank you AirBNB and I also thank you all for taking a look at my page.

324630,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/324630,Sean,2010-12-21,"I have been hosting people from all over the world through Airbnb for more than three years now and have really enjoyed the experience. Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That's what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life. 
Just like all of the travelers that I've hosted, I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia, Europe, and lived for a time in Micronesia. Each time I travel, I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss, and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you're looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century), I can definitely point you in the right direction. 
Speaking of directions, I bike a LOT around town and would be happy to provide a bike when you stay at either of my places. Boston may have a great (oldest in North America) subway system, but sometimes it's just nice to get on a bike and see where the next street takes you!
What keeps me not only travelling on Airbnb but also hosting are the notes that I frequently get, letting me know what a great time someone had or how much they enjoyed visiting a part of city I mentioned to them. These notes always put a smile on my face and leave me knowing that I have made someone's visit memorable!",within an hour,100,100%,f,https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/324630/profile_pic/1329710028/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/324630/profile_pic/1329710028/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Mission Hill,7,7,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio']",t,t,7,Boston, Massachusetts, United States

A little bit about myself and my home:

I am an entrepreneur in my late 20s working on a marketing company. I grow up in Brookline, MA and lived in Boston for most of my life. People who meet me usually take note of my love of helping people.  All my family and friends know I am the ""go to"" if they are in a jam, need advice or if the just need to hang out and have a good time. 

I started hosting on Air B&B December 2012 at my previous home.  I recently moved into a new house in August 2013.  I loved my first experience hosting throw Air B&B so much i decided to continue hosting in my new home.  In my new house I have taken hosting to a new level.  Firstly I used my extensive knowledge of Boston to find a home in the most perfect location for all travelers.  Once I found the perfect location I then focused my attention to providing a splendid stay.  I panted every room, brought beautiful furniture, plants, paintings and so much more.  My mission is to provide all of my wonderful guests with a hotel experience while still staying true to the bargain and homey feel of a B&B.  I always strive for perfection and I constantly look for ways of improving my home for my guests.  

I am a true Boston native lived here my hole life.  I know everything Boston so if you have any questions ask away!  I am a big sports fan on Sundays you will find me watching football and everyone is always welcome to join.  I love all kinds of food, which may stem from huge diverse family.  I love working out, running, biking, swimming, yoga and playing sports.  Boston is a very young city and because of that I need to keep myself fit and young in order to keep up with the city.  I love to travel I have been all over the world.  I enjoy camping, grilling, hiking... anything and everything outside.

What helps me the most with hosting is my love for people.   Having the ability to provide my guests with a amazing stay in Boston is my #1 goal.

Although I'm usually at The Finish Line on Boylston St near Dartmouth, this year I was at Home Depot picking up the final materials and fixtures for finishing up Project 158. 

And this Tuesday April 16 morning...   I couldn't sleep, I woke, wrote, went back to bed, got up again, and wrote some more. 

 I'm writing from Boston's Historic South End, it's 4:45am birds are beginning to sing. Sirens can be heard in the distance now. I live eight brief minutes on foot from the Marathon's Finish Line. I'm still in shock. Very sad and very angry that this could happen. Especially in this city, one of the most peaceful and progressive in the country.... happen in front of our library, the first public library in the country during a ""people's sporting event"". We are a city with many ""sport's palaces"" but this event is for the every citizen. It's not dominated by high salaries and expensive admission. It's a free event here in a city that so often makes history and writes laws that have extended social justice, rights, and freedoms to so many of us. We were the first Common Wealth and our constitution was the model for The United States Constitution which has extended rights and freedoms to so many. A constitution whose rights and freedoms are too easily limited by cynical people who sow fear and hate.
Now it's 7:24 am.. more sirens, the trash truck is trashing out back, the helicopters are again in the air, the streets are empty. Last night walking home from Foodies with salad-to-go, the few who were out walked in silence, the restaurants were closed. I'm in tears. I’m looking at my (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) cover photo singing with (URL HIDDEN) last March.

Our December 14 concert fades in. It was just after the senseless deaths of NewTown CT school children. Reuben, our director, introduced us singing Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah and I don't remember his exact words but they went something like... ""Today people asked me how we could be singing at a time like this, and I said HOW COULD WE NOT BE SINGING, singing Hallelujah. Cohen's, Hallelujah, a song of praise. A song that has more than 100 verses."" He went on. ""A song that needs so many verses because Cohen's asking... ASKING how do I sing praise... how do I sing Hallelujah."" 

Reuben's words stopped and our singing began, and when our singing stopped Jordon Hall rose in a standing ovation. It's was a moment I'll never forget, a Dec 14 moment, a day I'll never forget. I don't remember Reuben's exact words, and yet, I can rebuild what he said as the thought and the moment will never leave me. 

And now one day and four months later, in the middle of the month, on a day we celebrate our Patriot's, a holiday, a holy day, here in Massachusetts, in my city, my hometown, on the 17th century streets, streets I've walked countless times, there's more sudden senseless death. 

This time let's not use this sacred time as an excuse to start wars-for-profit. Here in Massachusetts we have the will to change our sadness, our loss, out anger into a social movement. Let us begin, and let us begin by singing, singing Hallelujahs.

I've been to New Orleans to work with Habitat for Humanity in rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina. I've hiked the White Mountains. I've trekked France, I've studied Spanish in Madrid, I've tossed bread crumbs to fish in Greece.

I am a high school English teacher and travel aficionado. 

I am energentic and enjoy meeting new people. 

Nevada, my dog, is named after the state in which I found her, abandoned at a rest stop almost ten years ago. She is amazing!

Besides Nevada, my interests range from wine, running, cheesey pop music, documentaries to just good old fashioned conversation.

I say that I pursue the ""impossible"" because these things have never before been achieved; however, I would argue that the reason is only because the proper plan wasn't put into place and set into action. :) 

Some quick facts about me: I was born in China but raised in the US - and I have lived in Florida, Wisconsin, Michigan, Missouri, and, lastly, New Hampshire. I am a recent college graduate (Washington University in Saint Louis) with a degree in International Area Studies. I am 22 years old. My current home is in Manchester, New Hampshire where I am serving as a proud member of City Year, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to addressing the national dropout crisis by putting young people into classrooms to both tutor and mentor ""at risk"" children. 

I am a friendly person (I think haha) and I love to travel and eat new foods. I would say that eating is one of my top hobbies and an embarrassing amount of time/brainpower in my each day is devoted to  figuring out how to make food/get food. My current plan in progress is to make homemade ginger beer (i.e. ginger ale). Fingers crossed! 

In addition, I like to watch Asian dramas, baking, reading. Also, I am a pretty consistent runner/gym goer (I mention this because this wasn't always the case ... sticking to that New Year's resolution!) :)

Option 2: The PINK ROOM, available every day all year round, is a beautiful private room in our three bedroom home. This custom built (by me, with help) house, is an urban artist's paradise that feels like a cottage in the woods. 

A BIT ABOUT ME: 
If I were to pick two single, most important characteristics to describe in myself, I'd choose that I am an artistic maker of things & spaces, and that I adore being a person. 

HMMM... WHAT DO I LIKE?  
Well, I'm an avid and high-speed reader. The apartment, the Pink Room, and my home are filled with books. 
Language, for me, holds an endless fascination. While I am not multi-lingual, I consider communication a most important human activity. Telling and listening is, when practiced, what brings the world together. Additionally, my daughter, who is still at home and often my co-host, is fully bi-lingual in Russian and English, as well as being fairly proficient in ASL. We both have some Spanish. My hope is that guests trust that whatever their point of origin, they will feel comfortable here.

Feeling at home in the world, for myself, my family, and others, has always been a vital theme for me. I've lived and worked on St. Kitts in the West Indies, hosted several different exchange students from Russia, given  presentations about Solar Energy in Kenya, lived in the woods in Northern Vermont, worked with trauma survivors for much of my career, taught building skills and trades work, and in these last many years, found a way to thrive in an urban environment.

As a mother of 3 and 'Babaka' now to two grandchildren, my core beliefs about staying in my own integrity, living out of my deepest artistic sensibility, and trying with a tenacity that never stops, have served me well.

My style as a host for Airbnb is to offer, as best I can, as little, or as much, as is wanted by my guests.

I am a relatively new member at airbnb and could not be more excited about this new journey in my life - having spent the last 20 years in the fascinating world of finance - I could not be more open to a change in scenery. Although I love finance - meeting and hosting people from all over the world has an extraordinary appeal to me. I raised six children - yours, mine and ours. They range from ages 19 through 24 - a true Brady Bunch - 3 girls and 3 boys. All of them are doing wonderful things and have moved to school, serving in the military or have started their own family. Like a significant amount of ""middle aged,"" folks I am not only an empty nester - but have recently become single and am rediscovering myself and life. What a fascinating journey that is. One of the big steps that I took was to move into the city - my motivation for the move was that I thought it would be a lot more fun than living in the suburbs. I was correct. There is never a dull moment in the city! The people watching is captivating - the culture is bright, enthusiastic and alive with a feeling of constant rebirth - students moving in, moving out, medical professionals coming in and then moving on, business professionals attending conventions and tourists visiting our fine city and then returning home - It is truly a magical place and there is no where that I would rather be - well...ok - maybe I would like to be in Namibia, South Africa.

After work and on the weekends we are usually busy exploring the many facets this beautiful city of Boston has to offer. 

We love to cook dinner together and we hope you will join us occasionally. We enjoy a glass of wine while relaxing on our porch and watching the city around us move. We will also take a relaxing evening in watching a movie or catching up on a television show while putting together a puzzle.

We have lived all over Boston but have always considered Jamaica Plain the best neighborhood in town... partly because it is a true neighborhood. Nowhere else in the city can you be 5-minutes from dense nature that obscures the hustle and bustle of urban life by Jamaica Pond or the Arboretum, while still being minutes from Fenway Park, Longwood medical center, and great restaurants!

I am a former Boston concierge, and local attorney and I hope you take me up on my hospitality advice and don't need any legal advice during your visit to Boston lol--but if you do, your stay with me includes a free legal consultation! 
My guests have access to the very best restaurants, café’s, bakeries, pastry shops and Italian import stores in all of Boston and they are steps from Girasole.  Many Italians have names for their homes to make their sense of arrival and time spent there more enjoyable. Girasole is the Italian word for “Sunflower” but the literal meaning of Girasole in Italian is “turns to the sun.” It is my pleasure as your host to turn you toward what are the brightest, best, and most Italian of experiences that are available in Boston’s Little Italy. Inside Girasole there is a list for you to make your wandering around the neighborhood more purposeful so that you can run into the best life has to offer during your stay.

In late February, I started working full-time in the Boston office of Fasten with the official recruitment team. I recruit drivers, sign them up, handle their applications, and help improve the driver/rider experience.

I used to help at Pinch! App. With a team, I helped conduct market research, recruit pinch pros, and recruit Lyft drivers to promote the app.

Most recently, I was living in Tulsa, OK and working as a personal assistant/ driver. I called my services Cloudride. In Tulsa, I rented my cars on Turo  (I still do this), taught 2nd grade for Teach for America, drove for Lyft, and delivered for Midnight Grill Delivery. 

I am a dabbler and have my hands in different markets. I am not a typical 23 year old. I spend most of my time networking and talking/learning from others about tech start ups, finance, and self sufficiency.

I grew up in Guatemala City, Guatemala and Anderson, South Carolina. I am fluent in Spanish and learned to speak English when I was nine. 

 I attended the number one ranked residential two-year college in the country, Spartanburg Methodist College. I graduated number one in my class with an associates in liberal arts. Afterwards, I transferred to the best all women's college in South Carolina, Converse College and graduated top 10 with a B.A. in Philosophy.

I am absolutely obsessed with the economical idea of a shareconomy (peer to peer access to goods and services.) My interests are centered around apps that focus on logistics.

I traveled back and forth to Boston during the mid-80's and 90's. I'm the founder of a non-profit organization here in Boston called, ""Bikes Not Bombs"" (BNB) where i worked for 25 years coordinating the international work as well as helping to start the inner city youth programs here in Boston and a bike shop which BNB currently operates.  Sixteen years ago, my partner Cecilia and I started to create a family, we have one 15 year old son named Ziggy. Cecilia is from Argentina and we are all bi-lingual Spanish and English speaking. Cecilia is currently working as a case manager for a live at home elderly services and support organization. In 2010 my family and I traveled by public busses for two years, homeschooling our son and witnessing life in nine South and Central American countries. We started the trip by car camping across the USA for 3 months, then selling the car, flying to Buenos Aires and slowly returning over land by bus, boat, and train, on two occasions we also did WOOFING on family farms.   
I'm currently doing carpentry and handyman work, but because of some issues with pinched nerves i'm looking to find more ways to make a living including airbnb.  I love traveling, bird watching, hiking in nature, fishing, books, cooking, art, bike riding and sustainable organic gardening among other things. I tend our 30' by 60' garden and grape arbor which makes our house exceptionally nice from May to November.
I know Boston metro-plex quite well and can help you to get around on or off the beaten track.

Today I got to stay at home. I work freelance in film production so I get a lot of time off between projects. My job is best described as ""art department"" although, set builder, propmaker, prop, effects, set dresser... are other terms for the work I do. Anyway, art dept. is what I write on my time cards. Today I did none of that. I fixed up a couple of 80's Japanese road bikes and one 60's Raleigh 3 speed in the sun in front of our house. Me and my daughter are getting ready to go down to NYC where we will set up our wares for sale on the street in Brooklyn (15 bikes and a table of her arts and crafts). Can't wait. It's super fun to be on the street talking to the people, hearing the music from the passing traffic, smiling at the ladies, eating crazy street food, and putting people on nice bikes. This is the best kind of day for me. It's got everything, travel, all kinds of people, my daughter w/ me, friends dropping by, a couple bucks in my pocket, truck tacos, street fashion... Magdalena , my 15 year old, creative, self possessed, funny, daughter makes me feel proud and secure when she hawks her crafts. I look at her talk everyone, so confident, open hearted but savvy, and I feel like she's gonna be okay where ever she goes. The art of survival. I'm an artist. Sculptor. Went to art school. Can make anything. But what I love most to make is my way thru life. It's the best art. But unlike art it is totally accessible because everyone does it. blaa blaa... back to today... I also did some drawings for a chicken coop that I'm going to build next week with my buddy Jenny. Some local chicken activists approached us with the project. These chicken people want to repeal laws that prevent keeping chickens in the city of Boston. They would like to display some chickens at our local earth/may day festival in a clean,(hopefully) well designed, urban chicken coop. What else? I fixed the passenger side headlight of my truck, paid some bills, ate some mochi, did the dark laundry, made some calls to spread the word about a friend who is on his last legs in a fight w/cancer, pulled some bamboo shoots that were creeping ever further out of their corner of the yard. Magdalena came home tonight beaming. There was an after school dance, ice cream with friends afterwards and thrift shopping after that. She sat on the couch and gave me a play by play of her day. I love that
Well, there it is. I think that worked out pretty good. It's a good thing I didn't work today or you'd of heard all about it...
IE: today I built a city diorama in 1"":1' scale. Went pretty smooth but the tiny bus stop benches looked gigantic next to the wee news paper boxes. Weird because both were built with out straying from the 1"":1' format. It just goes to show you, sometimes it's best to set the rules aside and go with your eye and your heart.

I like to refer to myself as a retired elementary teacher although I spent the last quarter of my career as an administrator.  But my teaching years were my best.  The daily student teacher interaction, the laughter and frustrations, the little signs of progress, made the work so fulfilling.

I grew up on a very successful produce and dairy farm in Southeastern Massachusetts.  Our main cash crop was tomatoes but we raised all kinds of vegetables.  They were trucked into Boston.  In the winter the dairy supported us.  My childhood exposed me to hard work but also to a love for the outdoors and nature.

Out of college I worked for the Department of Defense as a teacher in their overseas dependents' schools.  I taught in Istanbul and Seville, Spain.  I was able to travel extensively through Europe for three years.

Upon returning to the States I began teaching in Quincy, Massachusetts, where I remained for thirty years.  The last seven years were spent as a principal of an elementary school which has a majority population of Asian students.  I traveled to China one summer to explore my students' heritage and culture.

In the interim I married Joyce Brothers.  Joyce is a case manager for Boston Senior Home Care.  Her passion is cooking and she is a graduate of the Cambridge School of Culinary Arts.

She and I have raised two children.  Our daughter is a school teacher.  Our son, born in Brazil, is a hair stylist.

Here's a little bit about me-
I studied photography and worked as a professional photographer for the past 25 years. My favorite type of photography is Documentary and photo journalism. You might see some images of my work around my home.
I know my city well, and I love giving my guests tips and ideas for fun things to do. So please tell me a little bit about you and why you are coming to Boston. wether you want to stay local and find out more about JP, or if you want to explore the downtown areas of our city, I can guide you. 
I also consider myself a new urban gardener. I started a small gardening business a few years ago, and I participate in a community garden down the street from my place. 
I especially love meeting new people and hearing their stories. After traveling through Italy this past Spring (2015) and staying at several airbnb's, I decided to try it myself. I think I will make a great AIRBNB host because I like to make people feel comfortable and I like to chat. We went to Italy to celebrate my daughter's graduation from Syracuse University. We really enjoyed the AIRBNB experiences we had.  
My friends say my home is very welcoming and friendly. Currently, my daughter and another Syracuse Grad are living on the second floor with me and our cute cat named Remi.

I hope you find that place in the studio apartment in my home.  As a Peace Corps Volunteer I lived in Yalta, Ukraine, shortly after the breakup of the Soviet Union.  That afforded me the opportunity to travel throughout Eastern Europe and Russia.  Since then I have worked in the Balkans, and have also traveled throughout Africa.  Currently I am focused on the trafficking of women and other aspects of modern day slavery, and am looking forward to new horizons.

One of the great things that I enjoy in Boston is it’s open space.  My home is located within several blocks of three of those great parks.  Another great treasure in the Boston area--and one of the reasons that I moved to Boston--is it’s location on the ocean, and the opportunity to sail.  You can go on whale watches, cruises around the harbor, or take the water taxi to visit Old Ironsides.  Boston also has wonderful museums and a great public transportation system to take you there.

My childhood in Morocco taught me Arabic, French, empathy, respect, resourcefulness, flexibility and quick problem solving skills.

My parents gave me their thirst for learning and continuous improvement, their professionalism, work ethic and dedication.

My seven years in France sharpened my taste in European pastry, Caribbean music and fed my general knowledge.

My seven years so far in the US awakened my passion for running and thrift shopping.

Now ? I am :

- making my way in the fascinating world of Non Profit Project Management.
- running 10k every two days.
- learning Spanish.
- reading every book I can find by Marcel Rufin.
- watching religiously Suits every Thursday and Ballers every Sunday.

My husband and I have been using Airbnb as guests for the past 2 years and started hosting ourselves on August 2015. We are multilingual, curious about every other culture and traveling is basically a second nature (as much as an addiction).

Looking forward to meet you as guest or host (or who knows, maybe both).

I'm easy to get along with, and fairly adventurous.  I enjoy everything from luxurious hot spring destinations to third world countries.

I've got the bug and can't wait for more - I am fascinated with people and humanity, which includes the history and culture of each place I visit.  As a traveler I spend a lot of time wandering around places, people watching, or finding quiet places to enjoy the nature and try to stay fairly centrally located so I can walk and take things in slowly.

I started on Airbnb with our Cape Cod property in May 2015 and then listed this newly renovated Boston property on August 1 after a year long building process! 

I have been successfully renting the Cape Cod home for over 10 years and have wonderful reviews on the We Need A Vacation website (id# 7281). Also,  I was a landlord before we converted to condos here in Boston for 10 years prior to that.

I promise you I am extremely accommodating to all of my guests. I make sure everything is perfect on arrival and I am accessible whenever needed. In fact, we received Superhost status on October 1st and again on January 1st of this year!

Aside from hosting, I am an advertising executive in Boston, wife to David, my partner in life and all things real state and mother to our wonderful daughter, Adria, who is in her senior year of high school and off to Chicago to attend Northwestern in the Fall.

I am enjoying meeting new and interesting people from around the world through Airbnb and making sure I provide the highest quality experience possible for all of my guests.

Thank you for taking the time to view my listings and hope to hear from you!

Warmest regards

Sue

I'm a 29 yr old female professional living the single city life in the Beacon Hill area of Boston, MA. I feel pretty lucky to be able to live in such an incredibly diverse area with so many opportunities for adventures! 
Things I love: running the Charles River Esplanade in the mornings, exploring the menagerie of bars/restaurants/venues that are literally within walking distance, beachin' it in the summer and sledding the streets of Beacon Hill on makeshift sleds when the snow storms roll in and stop the world from turning :). 
I've got a wicked case of wanderlust so travel quite a bit-- and I figured why not share my cute little bachelorette pad with the masses while I'm gone? 
I'm pretty new to this whole AirBnB thing, but I'm excited to be apart of this cool little community-- feel free to ask me any questions! I love meeting other travellers and helping them get to know this incredible city-- so if you need recommendations on dining/bars/activities or really anything, feel free to ask! I've spent the better part of the last 3 years educating myself on the best that Boston has to offer. :)

My boyfriend, Jason, grew up in Hong Kong and came to Boston for college. He and I travel internationally for several months durng the year, but always come back to this city for its incredible food, fun atmosphere, and because it's our home.  We live in the 'burbs (about 15 minutes away) with our Siberian Husky.

The two of us have grown up traveling. We've experienced five-star accommodations from our previous ""business"" careers in management consulting and accounting. We have also traveled through the Jordanian desert sleeping in Bedouin tents and with Northern Thailand families in bamboo huts. The common denominator that we feel makes a wonderful accommodation is when a home-y and comfortable space.  We've designed the apartment with this in mind. All ceramic pottery pieces were designed by my Aunt Sally. All framed prints and canvases were photographed by Jason or myself. 

When traveling, our main focus is always food. We love our meats and seafood.  The one thing that makes my eyes pop is dessert. Jason is all about his red wine, scotch and other classic drinks.  Our second focus is the local experience. There is so much more to a city than historical buildings, duck  boat tours, and the Freedom trail (all of which are amazing).  There are the North End side streets for delicious lobster rolls, local markets (like the South End SOWA), and really interesting one-day volunteer opportunities.

Loved to travel around Europe and always enjoyed the hostels we stayed in! After moving to the states I have tended to remain up here in the North East, travelling around Massachusetts to New Hampshire up to Canada - generally on the hunt for good skiing.

While in Boston I try to balance things out between working away as a code monkey and trying to pull together a startup. With a few hours still going to waste, I've gone back to school with evening classes up in Harvard Extension. 

I love having friends over - I'll throw together some random event, be it Johnny Appleseed Cider Fest or a Spaceballs movie night. Something to get friends together.

I live car-free, so accessible is everything to the South End. And if you need wheels, Zipcars can be found within a block or two.  

Boston is historic and full of green space, with art and architecture to die for.  If you're into the arts, as I am, you'll find that you can't possibly see and do all there is on offer.  If you're into sports, what could be better than the Red Sox, the Bruins, the Celtics....all playing in venues in the heart of the city?
