They find pleasure in their community, family and friend's as well as working in the garden, canning, cooking and eating. Fueled by a love of creating arts and crafts, they also enjoy improving their property. When they are not at home making things, Amber Jane and Justin love exploring the outdoors, as well as the happenings in and around Portland, where they have been residents since 1996. They have watched in wonder as their city has grown and blossomed into a dynamic destination filled with hidden treasures, always offering new and unique surprises to discover.

Together, Amber Jane and Justin run Little hen & HARE, an urban micro-farm just five miles from downtown Portland. On their quarter acre property they tend an organic garden and small fruit orchard which stretches to meet the edge of a chicken run where 5 to 10 chickens cluck about. They also raise Flemish Giant and New Zealand Red rabbits, all while chasing after their pre-schooler and running two successful businesses. 

Justin is an old-school sign guy who does hand lettering, gilding, carved signs, and wall jobs. Ever heard of a ""Wall Dog"", well come meet one. His business, Riede Signs, is in the shop out back. Amber Jane has been a designer for her own women's clothing line, Dress Up Alice, since 2005. Now she is a wellness coach and essential oil educator using doTerra Essential Oils. She has been trained in the Aromatouch Technique. Ask her more or schedule a FREE treatment. Monthly classes are always happening, guest are welcome (ask for schedule). They have an adorable daughter born at home, early in the morning in July 2011. 

Amber Jane and Justin love to travel and have used Airbnb on almost every trip since 2011. They had heard about Airbnb, the experience, meeting new people, seeing into the lives of neighborhoods far and wide. They have found fast friends, unique houses, beautiful decor, perfect locations and great prices. A Home away from Home. This is the experience they have had and now they hope to give the same experience to you.

1374638,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/1374638,Ken And Spyder,2011-11-05,"We are Ken and Spyder.  Ken originally from Chicago and Spyder from Milwaukee, WI. We have been Air BnB hosts for over 3 years, but in a home in SW Portland.  We purchased and moved into this sweet 1909 ""Four-Square"" in July 2014, and are still putting on a few finishing touches. We hope our home reflects our shared warm and whimsical personalities! It is something of a celebration center with lots of dinners, dance lessons, classes, parties and seminars held here.

About Ken: I love Portland.   Our quirky people, our food, the natural environment and the grace with which people easily evolve acquaintances into friendships.

I've traveled widely and speak French, decent German, survival Spanish and the international language of cooking.      If I had a month to go anywhere I'd probably choose Italy for its food and mellow character.     I've lived in Cameroon West Africa while in the Peace Corps, worked and lived in St. Louis and went to graduate school in upstate New York at Cornell. 

My career is in the finance industry and I have a very mainstream background but socially and politically am usually on the liberal side of most social issues.

My passion is the outdoors where I spend a lot of time hiking, camping and cross-country skiing.

I am also passionate about creating and participating in community.   Our home is regularly hosting an event of some sort and guests are always welcome to participate.   Examples have included salsa dancing, champagne tasting, pizza making, movie nights, meditation circles, workshops and seminars.       Since I'm not a musician or artist in any traditional sense, I contribute the art of being the host and see it as a sacred goal to bring people together in grace and comfort.

I'm a regular at ecstatic dance in Portland where on any night of the week you can find a fun, free-form dance to attend.  Am a fan of Burning Man too having attended a few times.

Favorite places in Oregon include Breitenbush Hot Springs, Alvord Dessert, Wallowa Mountains, water falls, our coastline, Sunriver, the Columbia River Gorge and most places where big trees grow.

About Spyder:  I’ve been living in Portland for 7 years, and love the fact that I can enjoy winter snow sports on the mountain, then leave it all behind, come home and hop on my bike to get around (you can't do that in Wisconsin in the winter)!  I love more than anything to be in nature and Oregon lends itself to that in extraordinary ways, from mountains to ocean to desert, rainforests, hot springs, and more. 

My next big adventure is to go scuba diving in a beautiful reef somewhere in this hemisphere.  

I'm the mother of an aerialist/stilt walking circus performer!

All aspects of health and wellness is my passion.  I am a Shiatsu practitioner and transformational coach (feel free to ask me what that is!) Eating well has been a focus since early adulthood and enjoy cooking, gardening and going to the farmer’s market.  I also enjoy making herbal tinctures, tea blends, healing salves and rich body butters.

Boredom is not in my vocabulary.  I'm a bike commuter, rock climber, backpacker, x-country skier, snowboarder, dancer. I love being creative, and making music.  Ken and I met through ecstatic dance here in Portland, and it is a beautiful, heartfelt community.  

Sure, we do this to make a few extra bucks but more importantly, we do it  for the chance to meet new people and to help them find the beauty of the Portland area that we love.   Our style is very low-tech and hands-off.   If you like to chill out on your own, please feel at home doing that.   If you'd like to share a cup of coffee or a glass of wine  - so much the better.

We look forward to meeting you in our home.

When I travel, I like to feel the same.  My goal with hosting is to make sure you have everything you need while you're enjoying this fabulous town.

On this trip, we connected with friends in UK, Finland, Paris and Dubai; we volunteered in Tanzania; we climbed Kilimanjaro and danced in Rio’s Carnival! And at the end of these beautiful and exhausting days, we still missed Portland. We missed our friends and the lovely fiercely creative and compassionate energy of this city. So, we came back.

Now, with two year old baby Leo, our travelling has slowed down. We use AirBnB as an opportunity to meet people from all around the world. Share travel stories and laughter!

We are decent cooks, better hosts and voracious eaters! We fill the house with delicious smells, laughs, and satisfied bellies.

Hafiz has eloquently summarized what we try to be,

Plant
So that your own heart
Will grow.

Love
So God will think,

""Ahhhhhh,
I got kin in that body!
I should start inviting that soul over
For coffee and
Rolls.""

Sing
Because this is a food
Our starving world
Needs.

Laugh
Because that is the purest
Sound.

These days I fill my hours with remodeling projects, teaching dance classes 2 nights a week, leading occasional workshops as a life coach, maintaining rental spaces, and dreaming of my next trip. Mostly I ENJOY life as I count my blessings.

My life motto for the last 10 years has been: 
""I live my life with grace, elegance and ease, gratitude and awe and with eyes to see the Providential serendipities.""  It's been a pretty fun way to live life.

On my morning walk today, I was thinking that maybe I should create a new motto for the next 10 years. When I do, I'll let you know.

We also love wine, being outdoors, camping, music, movies, donkeys (well, mostly Greta), and being big dorks. Travel would be one of our favorite things to do if we had some time... so instead we dream about it constantly. Greta completed the entire Camino de Santiago (a 500 mile walking pilgrimage across northern Spain) in the summer of 2013, we try to go someplace tropical every winter and we're planning a sojourn to China or Peru in the next year!

Cooking is a favorite pastime for both of us, and Greta loves to keep things clean and sweet smelling around the home. Chris plays guitar and sings silly songs about our cats, and every once in a while we like to have a game of street badminton. It's a real hard life in Portland, Oregon.

We are Tiger & Peacock (also known as Ian & Sharmil). Ian and I are both Desire-based life coaches and we work in the areas of relationships, intimacy, connection and communication etc, and work from home.  

We are happy to offer each of our guests one free introductory session (on any topic of interest) with either of us.  You can speak with us about it during your stay, message us via the app, or email us: (EMAIL HIDDEN) (Ian) or (EMAIL HIDDEN) (Sharmil) to set up an appointment.  

Sessions are up to an hour long and can be done in person during your stay, or via phone/video chat if we don't have an opportunity to meet with you while you are in town. 

And if you are interested but want to know more about what we do, we are happy to answer any questions. 

A little about us...
Ian and I find that community is an essential part of our way of life. I jokingly (and kind of seriously) say ""Now that you're here, you are family. Now that you know this, are you sure you want to stay?"" ;-) That's because this is our home, the home of our community (chosen family) and everyone we invite into it is done with love and we don't hide anything. We are real people who live real lives under this big beautiful roof. 

Our goal and desire is for our home to be your home-away-from-home and perhaps you will come to love it (in all it's quarks) as much as we do. 

*And we love greetings and farewells with hugs*

Meet the other member of our little team:
""Mom"" aka Sharon (Sharmil's mom) and house mom is the on-site host for our NE Broadway location and runs the day-to-day operations there. She's great for the warm motherly touch or sometimes the swift kick in the butt, when needed. ;-)

What others consume does not bother me in the least. I also don't deprive my body what it craves, I just try to make better choices.

I can't think of a better way to incur debt and believe that if everyone foster cared a child or a dog even if only for emergency placement, society would be so different.

I am religious about recycling to the point where I don't have garbage service, only recycling.

There's so much to do, from the fabulous restaurants, to the live music, festivals, skiiing, rafting, biking, kayaking, hiking and parks.  Such great wine and beer as well!

The former, wine, brought me to Oregon as a tourist, and soon I found myself attending wine school in Salem, just south of Portland 45 mintues.  I began my winery while attending enology/viticulture classes and have been making wine since 2006.  

I spent 11 years in the Air Force as a pilot, program manager and astroanutical engineer.  My two master's degrees are in Environmental Studies and International Relations.  I enjoy the outdoors immensely--hiking, biking, running, kayaking, etc.  I am more grounded and at peace in a place of natural beauty.  Thankfully Oregon and Hawaii have plenty of those places!  

An engineering job opened up on the island of Kauai as I was finishing school and I took this as a sign to begin making tropical wines.  I lived in Hawaii for almost three years and the second label, Island Mana Wines, was born during that time.  Mana means energy or spirit in Hawaiian.

The tasting room in downtown Portland features both my Oregon and Hawaiian wines, decorated in a relaxing island cottage plantation style.  The tasting room has a great vibe and energy.   I hope you can stop by and Taste the Spirit of Aloha with us during your stay.

I have hosted over 200 people at 4 different properties with over a 100 positive reviews.  While my location may change with time, the quality of hosting will continue to be welcoming and inviting.

I love Portland's older architecture and the feel of the inner east side neighborhoods that cluster from the river to Mt. Tabor and beyond. I moved into the Buckman neighborhood in the Hawthorne area in 1983 because it felt like home. It was still known as ""little bohemia"", where progressive and ""quirky"" ""alternative"" types were working to connect and increase the community feeling of the area. Way back when the cool cafes followed the community oriented people into these now trendy neighborhoods. Most of the rough edges have been polished off now and new urban shifts are taking their place for better or worse, but you can still feel the roots of the area, thank goodness. 
I'm an animal person, mostly vegan, gluten free, and happy to be a resource for healthy dining possibilities in the area. I host a folk music radio program on the local community radio station, KBOO, 90.7fm, kboo dot fm on the web, and usually feature live folkies from here and traveling through on my show. 
I have been a green, progressive, and gay friendly realtor for the past 28 years, specializing in homes with character, woodsy retreats, and small plexes, on the inner east side and all around Portland and certain outer areas.  If you're considering a move here, I'm happy to talk with you about Portland or about real estate.
My husband is a jazz, Afro Cuban, and Latin jazz drummer who leads a fiery hot, Latin, salsa and jazz band, Pa'lante.

1. Life is always grey - don't live in the black and white..

3. Rules are meant to be blurred.
4. Keep your word. Authenticity is a rare and valued quality. Get it and keep it.

I'm a Spanish teacher here in Portland, OR and have been exploring this fine city for the last 5 years. I love my neighborhood and all the amazing things that Portland has to offer (especially in the summer and fall) so I'm always excited when people come explore this place. Originally from Romania, I've traveled and continue to travel the world with friends and family. Life feels so short with the millions of sights and songs and smiles out there to experience. 
I love taking photos, cooking for friends and coming up with creative little projects (of which I actually finish maaaaybe 20%). I once decorated my fridge like a crystal palace with rabbit-fur lined egg bowl and 24k gilded goose eggs, etc.... one of my AirBnB guests took a photo of some of the items, photoshopped her face into the egg bowl and printed it out it for me. BEST THANK YOU NOTE EVER! No pressure :)
While I probably won't be in town during your stay, I'm happy to share recommendations for my favorite dining, wining, hiking, music, dancing, celebrating, picnicking spots (you name it).

A little bit about me: 
Julio is self-employed as a General Contractor, and very active in the Argentine Tango and Salsa dance communities here in Portland. He scuba dives, sky dives, and is active with Capoeira as well. He loves to travel and meet new people, is very social and outgoing, but appreciates a quiet place to call home.


As an experienced traveler, I know the importance of finding the right spot to call home while you're away from home. Recently in Puerto Rico I used Airbnb ourselves to locate a charming 2nd story apartment with a lovely host to call home for a week! I explored the ""real"" Puerto Rico - from food to nightlife and community. That's my style; yours may be different.

Every listing on Airbnb holds value for different people via the host, location, and amenities. During your stay I will ensure that we communicate as to what is important to you. Do you want help finding classically Portland things to do? Do you want to be led off the beaten path a bit? Do you want to a key and nothing more? We have lived in Portland for over a decade. I am very active in the community, and know a diverse cross-section of the city. I am more than happy to point you in the direction you'd like to go.

Come visit my beautiful city and have a cup of coffee with me on my patio!

Big Fan of people here, glad to meet and have at least brief interactions and cerebral interludes with the whole sh'bang and gamut of characters this planet provides.  Travel feeds me well.  Another way to get that vitamin supplement from life in the times between travelings is to be part of another's adventure in some small way.  Hence, my own fondness for travel and the moments of feeling at home in the most remote stretches of the world is what brings me to AirBnB.  

I have warm, inviting space to spare, as well as energy and ideas about this pretty city that I dug so much I had to buy a little plot in it for myself and to SHARE with YOU!  Portland is beautiful.  I hope to make your travel far more enjoyable with a relaxing home base to replenish in between forays into the wild fray!
My darling, trusty, sweetheart William is my able co-host (though not pictured, he's shy...) and a sweet addition to the casa's general goodness!
He is a fine horticulturalist and hobbyist filmmaker..
Also as of May 27, 2015 we have a newborn son who is an awesome component of the tapestry around here. Our resting space is separate from the rest of the house for the most part, but we do share common space daily as well.
I do a little work from the home a couple days a week, but it ought never interfere with your autonomous fun having whilst here.  Let me know if I can help you with anything.

Personally~
 I'm an easy-moving, joyful, well-adjusted, silly critter, musician, painter, cook, writerly sort, interested in health and wholeness, Chinese herbal medicine (the eternal study continues!) and Acupuncture. I'm a traveler, an explorer, innate documentarian and story gatherer.  I'm handy, oft DIY-style, prefer  repurposing and re-using things and building materials in my projects.  
 I appreciate, to the point of deep reverence, the natural world's offerings and feel compelled to protect it with conscious consumption and recycling etc. I love clever design, architecture and texture in living/ working/ growing spaces as well.  Fond of dirt, making food and flora in it.  
Plenty to do in the loosely sketched canvas that a new piece of land provides. If it suits your fancy, feel free to join me gardening during your stay. It's always fun to putter about in the yard with folks!

See you soon, with any luck!
-Leo

Our best trip so far was a quick jaunt into the Scottish Highlands. We centered around Glencoe and Glen Nevis and spent as much time as possible hiking around and climbing Ben Nevis. We also had a great trip to Yosemite to meet up with family, swinging through Sonoma and San Francisco on the way, and then Reno, National Caves Monument and Crater Lake on the way home.

When I travel, I appreciate a good bed, in a quite, private home-like setting.  And that's what I offer my guest.  As a new host it's been fascinating to hear people's stories and help them navigate their way around Portland.

I've lived in my house for about 15 years and have slowly created this lovely urban oasis.  I enjoy gardening, re-vintaging and creating cozy spaces where you can curl up and relax, or hang out and enjoy the gentle sounds of the city.

 Here in town,  I enjoy the many amenities of my local neighborhood: Zumba and meditation; great local libraries and book stores; the Columbia River; Downtown; cafes galore, galleries and hidden gems like the bathtub museum. I love the arts and culture that a city has to offer, especially modern dance, unusual places, and eclectic healing modalities.

I came to Portland do a year of community service with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps (JVC) and ended up sticking around.  The values I have acquired from my volunteer experience is that of simplicity.  I don't have cable or dish, I hand wash all my dishes, I ride my bike more than I drive and I try to grow my own veggies during the summer.  

I have worked at the University of Portland, a private Catholic university, for 15 years.  I bought my house here in North Portland (aka NoPo) in April of 2011 and enjoy sharing my space.

I'm active and athletic,  I've been immersed into the world of soccer/football since I was a kid and am currently a season ticket holder for the Portland Timbers (MLS).  There is hardly an activity I haven't enjoyed included running marathons, basketball, baseball, utlimate frisbee, disc golf,and especially hiking, backpacking.  This is an incredible part of the county!

I don't watch much TV, but I do love movies.  Guests are welcome to use Netflix during their stay.  The house is great for chilling out, reading a novel in the back yard, the Sunday NY Times on Sunday morning with a cup of coffee, or sharing a glass of wine while prepping for dinner.

We have been told we are laid back, generous hosts & we will be able to give you many spot on recommendations in the city or in the region as we have lived in & explored this area for over 20 years.  We love to share our insider knowledge of the quirky, community spirited, eco-minded ""Portlandia"" that everyone is talking about.

We absolutely love where we are located in the city directly across from Peninsula park with easy access to I-5, public transportation, bike routes & the trendy Mississippi & Alberta Arts districts.  We hope you will join us & share the space we have created for your enjoyment.

I am at peace when surrounded by trees, mountains, and water. 

Below is an excerpt from my travel journal. To read more of my adventures, visit (URL HIDDEN) 

We are Indiana Jones! We are National Geographic! We are fearless explorers! A hike through the jungle and then we are swimming (swimming!) into the vast maw of a cave, helmets and headlamps, absolute darkness with the lights off. No difference between eyes open and eyes closed. We splash along an underground river, sometimes knee deep, sometimes treading across deep pools, squeezing under boulders, into fissures, over rockslides, the stalactites sometimes brushing the tops of our heads, sometimes towering ninety feet above. Crystaline rock flows, sparkling in the glow of our tiny lights, shadows and browns and greys and greens. 

We are travelers in Xibalba, the ancient Mayan underworld. 

After an hour we climb a rock face, steeper steeper higher higher onto a plateau, cavernous, winding, bats, space, darkness, the headlamps barely piercing the depth of the darkness. And then, and then! There is a jug, half buried in the calcite. And there is a metate, and a plate and a bowl and they are impeccable and painted and carved and 1200 YEARS OLD, all just resting on the ground, not behind glass, no railings, no ropes, no signs. The archeologists left everything just as they found it, untouched, a living breathing museum, and I am imagining the elite Mayans with their bloodletting and sacrifices and ceremonies and everyone is whispering because this is a sacred place, a place of desperation for a failing civilization, a place of last hope for rain, please Chuc, rain. 

We traverse the flats amongst a hundred hundred artifacts, and then there is a ladder, which brings us to a deep alcove, high within the cave. Ten steps and there she is, the Crystal Maiden, a young woman, sacrficied to the gods, her bones crystalized and perfect. She lies with her legs straight but her arms splayed. Her mouth is wide open. She was strangled to death. And she is still there in her dark and cool and cavernous tomb, and we are there, breathing softly, averting our eyes out of respect for the dead, but also longing to watch the bones, watch their stillness. We turn back and she is once more plunged into darkness and I tremble as I descend the ladder.",within an hour,100,N/A,t,https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/4967953/profile_pic/1360026311/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/4967953/profile_pic/1360026311/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Hosford-Abernethy,2,2,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'kba']",t,t,2,Portland, Oregon, United States

to become who I was meant to be

ABOUT ME

I want to grow, learn and share as much as I can on this earth.

My career is in the field of international education, so I have worked as an administrator at a community college and at a corporate language center with international students from all over the world, both as an academic advisor and as a housing coordinator. 

I am also a lifelong learner who dabbles in freelance journalism, hot springs, photography, jewelry design and dance (of all kinds but especially salsa, bachata and tango).

I have an adorable Siamese cat named Hachi who is my sidekick. :)

I think everyone has a story to tell and would love to hear yours!

PHILOSOPHY

The highest aim of humanity is to know and love God and then know and love others.

*

WHY I'M ON AIR BNB

I'm always excited to meet fellow nomads and share travel wisdom! I want to share what I have.

Even if I could afford five star hotels every night I would choose couchsurfing or Air BNB over that any day because of the profound authenticity, unforgettable memories and friendships that form through this mode of travel.

INTERESTS

Photography, writing, singing, Latin dance, trying exotic foods, nature walks, jewelry-making, idioms, cultural exchange, drawing people out of their shells and connecting with humanity

Amelie. Life Is Beautiful. Born Into Brothels. Wasteland. Mostly Martha. Rainman. Grease. Winged Migration. The Story of the Weeping Camel. Unmistaken Child. Mao's Last Dancer. Wasteland.

AMAZING THINGS I'VE DONE

I´ve been charged by a yearling cow in a Mexican bullring (on purpose). And I've ridden in a hot air balloon at dawn over the mystical landscape of Capadoccia in Turkey.

TEACH, LEARN, SHARE

I can write communal poetry with you, or we can indulge in a chocolate facial or a bout of laughter yoga, and I would be delighted to give you Spanish and/or Latin dance lessons. I will also sing with you and teach you how to see the silver lining. :)

WHAT I CAN SHARE WITH HOSTS

My splendiforous and fantastic self!

I would not want to live without great friends, great food, worthy projects that stimulate my creativity, my health and my home. 
I have traveled fairly extensively in Mexico and speak simple Spanish. I was there a year ago in May to visit a dear friend in Oaxaca. I've also been to Europe, Canada and Alaska. 
The kinds of movies I like most are human stories, especially when about interesting, quirky personalities, like Harold and Maude. My music collection is very eclectic with everything from blues, to jazz, to rock, to Latin, to blue grass and most genres in between. 
I love to cook and most meals are made at home with fresh meat and vegetables (some from my garden) and keep processed packaged food at a minimum. I'm often accused of having only ingredients in my pantry and frig, but I also keep some healthier snacks on hand.
I love meeting people from other countries and have been a ""homestay"" host to students from Japan and Saudi Arabia. I also had a lovely Persian woman renting my spare room for about a year. I like showing people around the city and state, taking them to the coast, Multnomah Falls, downtown, outdoor concerts and to the many great festivals Portland hosts throughout the year. I have always done my best to make my guests feel a part of the family and give them the opportunity to experience the best of American life.
When I travel I usually go by public transit and would say I keep it on the cheap in general. I like to be close to the center of the action, but also enjoy going to the countryside.
I have just started hosting on Airbnb, so I'm looking forward to meeting some new and interesting travelers.

 My motto is ""live your passion.""  I'm friendly, helpful, and like to get to know my guests.

If guests suggest preparing a shared meal, I'm always pleased to take part.  Having lived many places in the world, I enjoy having the world come to me these days.  I enjoy learning people's ideas, insights, opinions, and having a stimulating conversation over a glass of pinot grigio.  I love exploring:  places, people, ideas, and new talents and skills.

I think that travel should result in interesting stories and photos to share with the folks back home, and a recipe or two.  I am always on the search for the best Indian food in every city I visit.

Our next trip is hopefully Spain in 2017 for the World Pride Festival.  

I like coffee, great food (but not pretentious), walking, taking new forms of transportation (as in ferries, pedicabs, bullet trains), talking to cab drivers and gardening.

A note about hosting in my home: 
AirBNB is based on trust and for it to work at its best, communication is paramount. I have acceptance requirements before I allow travelers to stay in my home.
 I require either a personal reference or a rental reference and a fully filled out profile. 
Here is a link to some tips and reasonings behind filling out your profile: 
https://www.airbnb.com/support/article/67
If you do not yet have any travel reviews or experience using airBNB, that's ok! Here's a tutorial on how to get a personal reference to add to your profile in lieu of travel reviews: https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/173/how-do-references-work
A little communication & reassurance goes a long way! Please make sure you have satisfied these requirements first before submitting an inquiry.

I'm fun-loving, very social and love meeting new people.  I embrace diversity and value people's differences as much as I enjoy sharing common interests with them.  
I am fascinated with other cultures and traditions and always seek ways to broaden my world. I figured opening my home to travelers would be a fine way to nurture that goal.

I love to garden, cook, read and I am an aspiring writer.  I love art in every form.  My music interests include almost every genre. Speaking of art, I'm something of an artist at putting my feet up in my garden with a glass of wine at the end of a hard day's work and you are welcome to join when you're here!

I wish I could travel more, but lead a very busy life helping manage a local restaurant. A busy fine dining/ live music venue featuring fantastic local musicians. 
Being in the restaurant/bar industry allows me to appreciate people from all walks of life.  Everyone has a story.  I look forward to hearing yours if you're in a sharing mood.
No pressure!  :)

I love animals as much as I love people.  My beloved Boxer, Mugsy died at the ripe old age of ten.  He went deaf in his last years, but since I have a background in special education, working with deaf and hard of hearing children, I had the foresight to teach  him sign language as a puppy, so we didn't have any trouble communicating in his last years!  It took me a long time to grieve for him.  My latest Boxer is Watson. He is a handsome, playful, very joyful companion and is also learning to understand sign language. Come meet Watson!

Being a Boxer owner might tell you a little about me.  Boxers are smart, loyal, full of energy, fun loving, and maintain their playful  ""puppy-like"" attitude their whole life!  They can also be rather stubborn and determined at times!   People who choose the breed appreciate those qualities, most likely because they themselves exhibit the same traits!   :) 
I'm humbled when friends have described me with these traits and surely aspire to live my life as large and loving as a boxer!  

I look forward to hosting you during your stay here in beautiful, Portland, Oregon!  Welcome!

As a single woman living with a dog and cat, I tend to spend a lot of evenings out on the town with friends or hosting friends on my back patio.  I'm a very warm and kind person and love sharing information about my city (as well as nearby hiking trails) with folks who are new to town.

I live in the heart of Portland. I run, surf and play soccer. I love good food and love cooking it, though I rarely, if ever use a recipe. I rarely drink, I don't smoke and I try to lay off of the sugar, but I do have a sweet tooth. Being considerate (considering how my actions effect others) is important to me. I read books and play music. I have a big beautiful shaggy Standard Poodle named Charlie.

As a guest, I leave things as I found them and I'm respectful of the hard work that people have put into their home and thusly treat it well. 

As a host, I want for guests to enjoy themselves and have what they need to be comfortable eg: clean towels set aside, current local newspapers, chocolate; the essentials. It's also my goal to be very clear about how things work in the house, while not overwhelming a guest with information.

we are willing to take good care of my guest. so if you need help, i will do what i can to help you. so please ask!
i will try my best to provide you 5 star experience during your stay.

however, i do need to say something upfront!
this is not a 150 dollar per night hotel room! what you see on the pictures is what you will have. if you need anything, you are welcomed to ask. if you are uncomfortable caused by something in the house, you are more than welcome to let us know and fix it right away for you.  we will try our best to make your experience better. 
sometimes, the guest did not say anything, and give us bad review which is not fair because :
1. we are not mind-reader! if you do not speak, no one will know!
2. this is a shared environment. it is not a 100% private 150 bucks hotel room. you only paid less than 1/3 of market price per night . so you can't expect everything here are perfect for you!
but we will listen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and try our best to make you feel right and comfortable!

I love hosting with airbnb and use this platform myself when traveling! It is such a joy to meet the wonderful people who stay in the Gilded Lily... Thank you for considering making the Gilded Lily your home away from home during your visit to Portland... I look forward to meeting you!

I moved to Portland in June and love it here! I spent much of my life in Southern California (13 years in San Diego) but have always wanted to live in the Pacific Northwest, so I am thrilled to be here! :)

My professional background is in Animal welfare. I have been the Executive Director of several animal non-profits in Southern California. I was the Director of Development of an animal shelter during our time in Northern California. I have a passion for helping make the World a better place for people and animals alike, which is probably why I've been so involved in non-profit management most of my life. I am currently focused on growing an online business.

Personally, I enjoy living a happy, centered, peaceful life. I approach every new situation with enthusiasm and a positive outlook, no matter what appears to being going on. I thoroughly enjoy meeting new people and always strive to make every encounter rewarding for everyone involved. I love practicing yoga, experiencing the serenity of nature (which is easy to do here surrounded by the forest with miles of hiking trails running through the trees, just a block from my home), playing with my two small dogs (Sophie and Finley), cat (Lily)... and of course enjoying quality time with my fiance, Ben.

I look forward to hosting you! I really believe that the ""Gilded Lily"" Suite will be a welcomed gift for individuals and couples visiting Portland; especially those people who will be going to OHSU (walking distance) or exploring downtown (short bus ride). The forest trails that are woven throughout the neighborhood are breathtaking and a great way to start or wind down your day.

Our two young adult sons (Zane & Max) live at home too, and are busy attending college, and doing all the stuff youthful persons do ~lol! And we also took in a charming young man who is seeking asylum in this country, one of thousands of kids who fled the violence in Central America- seeking asylum here.  We've lived two decades here in the South Tabor neighborhood of Portland.   Tom and I met twenty some ago while attending the University of Puerto Rico, and we love traveling, as well as opening up our backyard cottage & meeting new people!  There are some great walking trails - a couple of my favorites are walking on nearby Mt. Tabor park with views of the whole city.  I also enjoy the trail next to the Columbia River.  There are also plenty of fantastic places to eat in Portland including my own home cooked meals (breakfast is included in your stay) but I also offer home cooked meals to the public:  (URL HIDDEN)  I have coupons in the cottage for a free dinner or brunch for you to surprise your Portland friends with as an unexpected freebie!!!

There are always venues for music close by as well.  Just ask....

I'm an early riser, up at 5:30/6 and out to walk with my dogs.  I try to hike, bike and kayak weekly in the summer months, being outdoors is what I currently live for.  Winter is weekday trips up to Mt Hood skiing, with weekends on my snowshoes.

1996078,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/1996078,Sally K.,2012-03-23,"Hospitality comes naturally to us. We've come to learn that our most enjoyable guests enjoy taking care of themselves--and cleaning up after themselves. We love the simplicity, comfort and beauty of our home place, and we welcome you to find magic in the ordinary.  The guest rooms are on a separate floor from our living spaces, with 3 entrances to the garden. The garden is large & lush, with meandering paths and private places to be alone or together.  It's quiet here; the air is fragrant and full, with bird songs, creek sound, and honey bees. He is a farmer and I'm a psychotherapist. I see possibility and he likes hard work. We've been a good team; having found this crooked old house on a trash dump creek 20 years ago; we've cared for and cultivated what has become a very special place. We thrive on good conversation, food, music, books, art, wine, dance, & laughter. We also like our privacy, and the structure of the house provides plenty of room to choose that. You can choose solitude or conviviality here as you like. It's a beautiful place to gather with a small group of friends if they like to talk softly or go away by 10 pm. Sound carries through the floors, so there's headphones to wear if you want to blast the stereo or watch a movie late. The TV isn't hooked up; it's good for DVDs and maybe Netflix. There's some real food in the kitchen, fresh sheets on the beds, good towels, toiletries, espresso & tea.

22333154,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/22333154,Ingrid,2014-10-09,"We are an architect and a retired teacher of students with reading disabilities. I'm from England and my husband Dick is a native Oregonian. We greatly value activities with our large family. I look after my one year old grandson two afternoons a week. Our small mountain farm by Mount Adams brings a lot of peace, joy and much needed agricultural practice. We have a career changed guide dog who is a light of my life. Dick loves to design buildings, some we live in. He knows how to build almost anything. I love to draw and paint. Dick volunteers for historic preservation of Timberline Lodge, in planning for the needs of emotionally disturbed children and for the school district. The Ducks football team is a passion for him. I volunteer with my dog in the area of pet therapy at the local hospital, and for Guide Dogs for the Blind. Sometimes, I tutor people with learning differences. After finding I had some French left from my childhood, I began French lessons which I continue to enjoy.

Throughout my life I have traveled a lot. Although I grew up in England,  my grandmother's farm was in the North of Norway, near the Arctic Circle so I went there quite a bit as a child. Subsequently, I spent a year as a teaching volunteer in East Africa, a place always in my heart and which has inspired me to be involved in international volunteerism. Over the years, I have been to Costa Rica, Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Hawaii, Australia, Greece, back to England, France and Switzerland. We often travel to meet with my brothers who live in Australia and New Zealand. My brothers are very skilled at organizing and researching for vacations and always know a lot about transportation and housing options, local history and culture. 

Dick and I like to travel for as full a cultural experience as we can. We tend to avoid tours and hotels and like to have home stays. We fly often, but some of our best times have been had on canal barges in France and England, and, for me, on the chicken buses in Central America.

An avid reader, I've recently enjoyed Alice Munro, Anne Patchett and Barbara Kingsolver. A favorite book was Cutting for Stone by Abraham Verghese. With a view to understanding my parent's lives, recently I've been reading histories concerning the Great Wars of the last century, including the works of Winston Churchill. Dick and I differ in our movie tastes mostly because I don't like to watch violence and bad language which eliminates a huge percentage!. He chooses films like the Bourne movies whereas I went to see Iron Lady, Philomena and Saving Mr. Banks  this year. In the past, we have had season tickets to the local repertory theater. With two career musicians in the family, we listen to a lot of jazz and rock music. I like classical music, too, and the opera. 

Our family is 'foodie'. We have a lot of good cooks, including nearly all the men. Luckily, we live in a part of the country where there is a lot of interest catered to by amazing farmer's markets, restaurants and talented home chefs.

When traveling, we hope we are good guests. We have a great interest in our hosts and try to be culturally sensitive, responsive and responsible to each environment. As hosts of friends and family from all around the world, we have the goal of 'mi casa es su casa' and 'let's make it fun.'

My family fostered children and hosted a family of Vietnamese refugees when I was a child.

Cibyl and Ed: Hospitality is something woven into the very fabric our of being! In 2013 we decided to move the studio into the house and convert the studio into a guest cottage. We wanted to create a special, magical, secluded, intimate, welcoming space for people to enjoy for a weekend or for longer creative/meditation retreats, visiting family or simply vacationing . We are excited to share what we've created as well as our fabulous city and bioregion. 

Our cottage is located in a highly desireable, close to everything neighborhood in Portland. We take public transportation or walk to the cinema, restaurants, grocery stores, music or theater events, art galleries, bookstores, public gardens and much more.

We are a newly married couple living in Joshua Tree, California and Portland, Oregon. Michael has musician roots. Jenna hails from the SF tech world. We first began designing/building together in 2012 when we created the Rustic Modern Tiny House in Portland, Oregon. While building we were surprised to realize that we can make beautiful-awesome stuff together, and we love the process!  The Rustic Modern has been such a gift of creation, and we are so happy to be able to share it. 

Joshua Tree was our first weekend away together and we always loved it here, so we said ""Let's move to the desert so we can create more amazingness!""  Our most recent project was restoring a 1950s homesteader cabin. Just a little under 500SF but surrounded by huge open skies.  We never dreamed of having this much space. What we love most about the Home Sweet Homesteader is the view from the patio.  We, of course, have nothing to do with the sunsets you will see from here… but they are some of the best we have seen anywhere. 

Perhaps we shall cross paths - in Portland or Joshua Tree, or perhaps somewhere in between!

So much beauty, whether viewed from my back yard or from any of limitless perspectives in town and nearby. The neighborhoods are so fun to walk and explore. I do like seeing them on foot so that I can savor each step and what it reveals.

The past decade has been a time of significant transition for me, and I have come to see the re-creation of my home as a metaphor for the transformation of my life. I spend time helping others deal with the challenges of ending relationship and becoming a single person. Personal reflection is important to me, and the spaces I inhabit are designed to accommodate that. 

The garden is my renewed experimentation with growing food and inviting color. I am learning a lot! This year I hope to extend the growing season by trying out cold frames. 

I have traveled around the US and especially enjoy large cities where there is a different flavor in each section of town. I spent several months in central Africa a couple of years back; that experience shifted some perspectives for me about form and space. I made a few friends I hope to keep for life. It's been a pleasure to carry those things forward. If I am lucky, the day will again arrive when I can return and spend more time there.

Hosting for me means being attuned to what my guests desire. When you need suggestions, engagement, and connection... I am delighted to share what I have found. I also understand that sometimes you just want to be left alone. The space here accommodates that well. 

I am a fan of jazz, funk, and soul music. Yoga, dance, delicious healthy food, good drink, and coffee each have a place in my life and heart! I read for pleasure and learning.

As avid travelers, we have made the study of people, food, and cultures the thesis of our wanderlust. From cycling to surfing and from yoga to meditation, our interests are as diverse as there are cultures.

We believe a successful lifestyle is about balancing work, play, and rest. This means work that is intellectually stimulating, creative, and meaningful and down time is more than sleep.

We love meeting new people and introducing visitors to Portland and especially Multnomah Village. We'll be glad to share our favorite hike, restaurant, and shops with you. 

By working downtown Maria stays on top of the food cart and restaurant scene. To counter this appetite for good food she commutes by bike each day over Terwilliger Blvd. Portland is bike friendly (mostly).

Kenyon is in charge of the garden and as a flower farmer he knows horticulture. His garden was featured recently by Janet Eastman of the Oregonian. Search the web for ""Sleeping in Portland - Master bedroom conversion in Multnomah Village"".

I also an extremely happy Nana and I have three wonderful grand children - so YES I am in heaven!!!!  Right now I am taking care of my daughter's beautiful Golden Retriever - her name is Lua and she is the most precious beautiful girl ever!!  She is a big part of our family and is very friendly.  Normally I allow dogs but while I am taking care of Lua - I am not accepting pets.  Sorry but this will change in October of this year.

I love to cook and share it with my family and friends so my ""Outdoor Party Room"" is used often and always a great time to be had by all!!!  I love all kinds of music and play it loud and often - of course will always respect my guests and their space!!  Always loved dancing but now I mostly do it in the privacy of my own home, which is just fine - it's good exercise.  

I live five short blocks to the fun & funky Alberta Arts District. There are many fun places to visit in Portland & this area is one of them - for sure - anything you may want for your child, your pet(s) or YOU!!  Lots of great restaurants, bars, shops, the best Ice Cream shop ever (Salt & Straw), galleries - you will love walking up & down this street & I'm sure make many stops along the way.

I absolutely love living in the Northwest but love to travel to the Southwest and do it as often as I can, at least once or twice a year. Now that I am retired one of my desires is to see more of what this beautiful country has to offer and hopefully I have many years to fulfill that dream and will definitely be using Airbnb to make my travels that much sweeter.  I'm a really friendly person and just like my father & most of my family - we love to chat and smile and live life to the fullest as life is way too short to be grouchy for too long.  ENJOY Today as it is a present and there isn't any guarantee we have tomorrow.  So I choose to be Happy!!! 

Hope you choose to share my space, have a chat, share a healthy smoothie & or coffee in the morning, share a glass of wine (or juice) and chat about beautiful Portland Oregon.

My elderly and very sweet dog, Miss Abbey Zora Kuhn will most likely greet you with a song when you come home.  She is my best and most loyal friend—everyday with her is a blessing.  Sorry, hosting other dogs is more stress than she needs—at this point she is the queen and her quality of life dominates, as it should!  I believe in the Golden Rule: treat others as you would like to be treated!

Since we'll be traveling as a family I want to introduce all of us!
We are a family of three. Jeffrey grew up in Portland and has family with businesses here. He has been doing nonprofit work including consumer & environmental protection, and is currently in a leadership role with a public health and safety advocacy organization. Sona was born and raised in Armenia - pretty much the other side of the world. She has a master’s degree in oriental studies, speaks multiple languages, and currently does marketing for an international company. We have a wonderful and adventurous five-year-old daughter, Zoë (in the profile picture), who loves swimming, biking, drawing, dancing and singing. We all really enjoy exploring new places & countries -- and meeting new people.

I LOVE fresh baked artisan bread, being outdoors, cooking different ethnic food (mostly vegan) and exploring the world!

I'm a gracious hostess (Armenians are known for their hospitality) and courteous and appreciative guest. Besides English  I also speak Armenian, Russian & Farsi.

Our lives these days have a strong orientation towards things our daughter will enjoy doing, and fortunately she has pretty broad interests.

I hope to provide people with a pleasant stay and an opportunity to get the most out of their visit to Portland.

I like shiny objects, I find it cathartic to paint things gold, and I absolutely love Portland and this neighborhood.  It’s my mission to provide people in all stages of travel, transition, and transformation with a soft and friendly place to land in-between where you came from and where you’re going. For some, change, travel, and uncertainty are thrilling; for others it takes more courage. Either way, it helps to be surrounded by shiny objects, colored lights, and soft blankets.  I’ve created a grown-up playhouse for you – my vision of an idealized 1970’s childhood. This is a safe and private place where you can be yourself.

I try to create more than just a place to sleep and sit - there's a warmth and a silent light-hearted narrative in the spaces that I hope you will enjoy and appreciate.  And if you're at all interested in 50's - 70's vintage, this might be even more suited to your style.  

By day I'm a software engineer - specializing in Oracle ERP B2B and A2A XML integrations.  So if you wanna nerd out and talk about tech, yes!  If you wanna talk about rainbows and puppy dogs instead, yes!  

That's all for now I guess!

Bye!

5772713,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/5772713,Anna,2013-04-04," A little about me: I'm a 33 year old woman currently residing in Portland, Oregon. I have a true passion for all things vintage. I work for myself full time dealing vintage. I especially love refinishing old furniture (my therapy), big funky jewelry from the (PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN)'s (I have a getting-out-of-control personal collection of it), vintage pieces of original artwork (one of my flea market friends is convinced he sold me an original Worhal), any type of woven, colorful basket. (my current obsession), and anything Art Deco. I spend most days ""treasure hunting"" and sell my finds online, in a shop in Portland called Monticello,  and at local antique/vintage shows. One day soon- I hope to have a little vintage shop to call my own.
 In July 2014, a longterm tiny home owning dream of mine came to fruition when I purchased my current property, which came with a tiny cottage in the yard. I rent that out to longer stay travelers (30 days+), and when it has a few days open in between travelers, I invite my friends and family to come and stay in it. 

At this moment in time, my main focus is growing my businesses-Experimental Vintage,  and putting love into my almost 100 year old tiny house. I feel truly lucky to be able to do the things I love to earn a living! In my free time I enjoy meditation, photography, cooking and eating good food, drinking good wine, exercising, practicing yoga, and listening to live music. I have done some traveling- including a semester in Australia during my undergrad, a summer backpacking around Europe, as well as leisurely travel to parts of Indonesia and Costa Rica. I am hoping that a month in Thailand will be my next big adventure. I like to explore various hobbies and have dabbled in darkroom photography, jewelry smithing, furniture reupholstering, and other creative ventures.

Depending on the time of year, I will have a slackline set up in the backyard. If you've never tried it, it's unlike any other balance sport...basically a single line trampoline that feels impossible at first, but is actually quite manageable after a bit of practice.
I like gardening and have spent the last five years or so transplanting and cultivating trees, shrubs and sedums at the house. There are all sorts of perennial edibles here--cherry, plum, persimmon, fig, currant, blueberry, huckleberry, gogi berry, strawberry, pear, grape, asparagus, kiwi and raspberry.

 What's important to me as a host  is that people get the most out of their stay here.  Having lived here quite awhile, I am a font of info in a wide array of interests.   

I love it when people feel at-home, playful and relaxed.  And to see it in action, what more could a host want?  For example, a guest wrote in chalk on the sidewalk in front of the house a little road map to my house and pointed to house ""Paradise""   How fun is that? 

As a nano-bio,I am an artist, performer, RN-PhD, investor, entrepreneur, published author, host.  mother, and GRAND mother.   I love life and love creative expression. 

Currently, my focus is upon multi-month leases,  though short term stays are also graciously invited!  

My property, ""Mississippi Fun District"", is great place to be in Portland  with eats, treats and beats right around the corner. Home is secluded, yet in the middle of it all.  Easy to zip around town via walk, bike, bus, light-rail, car.

My rentals are in a duplex, therefore in same building. Same address.  When I am not traveling, I spend much of my time in the sunroom attached to the back end of the house  and in the art studio at the back end of the property. 

My raised beds grow food year around.  I am part of collective that share crops. 50% of produce is shared with volunteers and a local Soup Kitchen. You may meet volunteer gardeners and pick up some gardening tips for your own garden!

I look forward to your stay here for your future travel plans to Portland!

While we used to host in rooms in our houses, we now are able to offer four full houses - one in San Francisco, two in Portland, and one in our favorite Southern city, New Orleans - for your traveling pleasure. We take great liberties to make sure our homes are more comfortable than any hotel will ever be, focusing on Temperpedic beds, fully-stocked kitchens, local artwork, outdoor areas and fluffy bath linens. We have been doing this for a while now, and have a grip on what our guests are looking for: luxury while still being local. Our reviews speak for themselves - read them and feel confident in your decision to stay with us!

I like providing a comfortable respite from the road, and I definitely enjoy meeting people from all over.  I live across from a beautiful neighborhood park that has tennis courts just steps away, and provides a serene setting, yet is close to all the great activities in neighborhoods downtown, in Mississippi, Alberta Arts, and Piedmont, to name a few.  The house is half of a duplex.  It is a 1500sf unit with 3 bedrms, 2.5 baths, hardwood floors in the ""great room"" which is one big room including fully loaded kitchen, living room, and dining room.  People love the openness of the main floor.  French doors to small front yard provide an open, friendly area for morning coffee or regrouping over wine in the evening.  Other amenities include laundry room, full service refrigerator, and ample street parking.  Conveniently located just a half block to bus, 6 blocks to light rail, I-5, and New Seasons whole foods store, 10 minutes to downtown (unless you want to take the bike trail, which makes it more like 20 minutes).  

I am a writer and singer, and I have a lot in common with artistic types, but love to get to know all types of people.  I'm definitely open and somewhat savvy about the world, though haven't traveled much (that's about to change, thanks to AirBNB!).  Come enjoy a weekend, a week, or a month in the hidden Arbor Lodge neighborhood.  I live here because it's close to everything, and yet feels like I'm in the country.  A second park is only a block away, and the University of Portland and Adidas campus are just a few blocks away, along the bluffs overlooking downtown .  I can help you get to know our completely amazing jewel of a city!  My life mission is to ""make a difference.""  This is my hosting style too.  Welcome.

I am a life-long traveler and always have appreciated finding kind and happy people wherever I go, and I know from first hand experience that hospitality can be the difference between a so-so experience and a wonderful one. 

When I opened the Evermore Guesthouse it was a dream to get to provide a unique, comfortable space for others visiting Southeast Portland, and I modeled it after all the best aspects of my experiences along the way.  Hosting is our passion we really want you to have the best visit possible.

During the 1990's I lived in a ski town in Colorado and worked in hotels and vacation rentals while living the life of a snowboarder.  I don't get to the mountain quite as much anymore - these days as an urbanite I play soccer and bicycle - but I found my calling in innkeeping.  When I first moved to Portland I worked my way through college as a host at a traveler's hostel, and after graduating I ended up managing it for 6 years.  Now my wife, staff and I run 2 guesthouses in the Division / Clinton Neighborhood, and I hope you have a chance to stay with us!

I love to soak in different cultures, peoples' points of view, beauty, sights, sounds and flavors. I have traveled and lived extensively in Asia.

I am now in the stage of life where I can travel to locations and have adventures that are on my ""bucket list"". I feel very blessed to meet people from all over and make life long friends.

We love to have visitors, guest artists, friends and family members come to stay with us.  We try to host parties when we can, and keep the house buzzing and doors open.

I've had the great joy of traveling and doing theatre/artistic work in Eastern/Central Europe, Mexico, the Balkans and Turkey.  We've also camped across as much of the US as we can, even crossing coast-to-coast via Amtrak on a loooong trip.  And we've begun to steadily try and see every mountain range on the west coast in summer camping trips from the Canadian border down to California.

Favorite trips have been the times we stayed for a month or more with our friends in their homes (Mexico City, Szamocin Poland) and got to know their real way of life, meet their families and friends, and eventually take part in festivals, birthdays, celebrations, road trips, adventures and family dinners.

My favorite way to travel is to show up without much of a plan and learn from the people I meet where we should really go, and what to see, and the best ways to travel and the foods I've never heard of... to really discover something different than I ever knew before I left.

I love traveling and I LOVE even more being a host of travelers - whatever brings you on your journey, work or love or experience!

I started traveling by myself when I was 18 in 1989. Long before there was email and all of the cool things to support backpackers today, I had traveled many places; I survived and thrived because people gave me food, took me around, gave me lodging, rides to the airport and took care of me when I got sick. So, I am always looking for the opportunity to help people out on their journeys!

My greatest travel passion is visiting national parks in eastern and southern Africa - so far I have been to 17 parks and I am in love with African wildlife and cultures.

But besides Africa, I love SE Asia culture - especially the food; I love Italian culture - especially the language; and, more than anything, I want to go to Mongolia, Bhutan, Khazakstan and Wales.

I am very much into the Slow philosophy as a lifestyle - I am an avid gardener and adventurously good cook.  

My biggest dream is to travel the world via dirigible.

As your host at PandaFaerie House here in Portland on Mt. Tabor, you will always find local roasted micro lot organic fair trade coffee or organic hand picked tea, a nearly complete Charles Bukowski collection for your reading voyeurism and a totally friendly greeting committee comprised of my dog, Bunny aka TACO.

We are travelers and try to getaway whenever we can. We love Mexico, Central America and would love to do more exploring in South America. Ecuador and Italy are two of our favorite places. 
 
Family and friends are a priority and spending time with them was one reason we decided to host through Airbnb as we wanted to have a comfortable, nearby place for them to stay when they're in town. Our property is kid-friendly, complete with a swing on the old apple tree.

In addition to Eric and me being around to help out and answer questions; our manager, Evelyn, who lives on site, is also available. We trust your stay with us will be all that you hope for (and maybe just a little more!).

I'm a Prop Master and Set Dresser for local theatre although I hope to write, direct and act sometime soon. 

I enjoy books, movies and shows.  You can often find me gardening at home, feeding the crows and hummingbirds, or sitting on my back porch.  Biking and walking around town is fun too.

I perform improv on the weekends and am an ensemble member with a local theater company.  I enjoy staying active and traveling.  I'm not a big drinker but enjoy dancing and seeing live music or theater.   I also enjoy watching movies and going for long walks around the city. 

The space I host is warm and accepting of other peoples culture, ethnicity, race, religion, sexual orientations and identities. I value diversity and consider myself to be open-minded.  I am available to help if you want advice about where to go or what to eat but I will not impose on your vacation or trip.  I understand the value of giving people space.  I'm very busy but you can always reach me by phone if I'm not at the house.  When I travel and stay as a guest I am clean and respectful of other peoples spaces.  I am a seasoned traveler and I don't require much assistance in most cases.

My name is Mazen. I was born in Homs, Syria, a major trading city on the west side of Syria, near Lebanon. In 1997, at the age of four, my mother and I moved to Portland. After two months of living with a relative, we got our first apartment on 30th and Belmont. There, we settled in for a short while before moving out toward SE Portland. 

By the time I started first grade, my mother and I found a great apartment near SE Portland.  There, we stayed for nearly 17 years before my mother re-married and moved out and I settled into a condominium in downtown Portland, where I currently reside. In my life, 

I've traveled to Jordan, Lebanon, countless cities in Syria, southern Turkey, Amsterdam, San Francisco, and, most commonly, Seattle. I laugh when I share my list of travels as I have never been Vancouver, Washington (a mere fifteen minute drive from Portland), Bend (a three hour drive), or Eugene (another three hour drive). There are many places in the world that I wish to travel to. The top on my list include Ireland, Germany, and Norway.

I finished a trip through Iceland, Paris, Amsterdam, and Berlin in September of 2016. I have always wanted to travel to Germany because I took four years of German language courses in high school and two terms in college. I thoroughly enjoyed the trip and am excited to (maybe) move to Amsterdam in the future.

When I travel, I travel light. One suitcase is what I limit myself to. I leave a little space for gifts and souvenirs I know I will bring back. It is almost embarrassing how much of my travel expenses go toward food. On my five-day, four-night trip to San Francisco, I flew back home with a brain full of awesome memories... and a keychain with a decorative Golden gate Bridge image printed on it that I found in a restaurant. The rest was spent on amazing food.

I am more aboriginal than I am techno and cyber, though I am fairly savvy in the latter realm…

I am sometimes a stubborn and fierce activist...

I am a holder of contradictions...people have a hard time defining or pinning me down in an easy all-inclusive bundle--just when they think they know me--they are completely surprised by some new facet.

I am a true romantic at heart…yet anything that even hints at being uber-trite or a bad cliché makes me a bit ""cringy"" and ""crawly"".

I believe in timing and synchronicity…

I absolutely love the things that defy...the irrationals as I call them.

I have a huge replenishing well of ""joie de vivre"" and I am a completely self-professed existentialist~paradox~ (awe the beautiful contradictions) though I view the angst as just an element of life's ironies and an inseparable part of being given a mortal coil and an earthly existence...though wings should be arriving soon...even with the courageous acceptance of irony and angst I am a full-blooded optimist…

I get heavy hearted when I read or watch the news too much, lose a client, or feel my heart is not being cared for properly--but I am also very resilient by nature...

I tend to pass through my funks rather quickly...and if I don't my host of comrades will pull my head out of my ass for me...they are such a blessing...

I love adventure and I find great beauty in the mundane.

I love the combination of fire and metal, thus love anything combustible and incendiary

I always try to stay in the present in both mind, body and spirit, with eyes always gazing into the future or towards whatever my heart is calling to my attention to in the moment.

I am a life long avid sailor who grew up sailing and racing on the Great Lakes. At 12 years old I had the great good fortune of getting aboard a famous old 1938 racing sailboat: the 12 meter US 14 ""The Northern Light"", and pretty much spent my summers aboard cruising and racing all around the lakes. I love being on the water and under sail... After having had a blast working for years in film and television as a ""Props guy"" I am getting back to a deeper passion: teaching sailing again. (I am a USCG Licensed Captain and an American Sailing Association Certified Instructor). You can find me most evenings (or join me if you wish! Be sure to check out Agwe' Sailing on line) out sailing my vintage 1978 sailboat in the most amazing summer breezes on the mighty Columbia river... Wanna go for a sunset sail?!

I also lived in Germany for many years (my family is from a small village there) those were incredible times... ask me about Berlin in the early 90's...

I went to school at the University of Oregon and from there found my way to Alaska and before I knew it I was a commercial fisherman for some years and worked throughout the waters of Alaska - experiences I will treasure all my life.
(Umm, after my first very successful season fishing I never really went back to school... I think I'm still owing some fantastic professors a few papers on European intellectual history...)

I fell head over heals in love with Portland in the 80's when my travels and education brought me to this part of the world. I settled here year round in the mid 90's feeling still as I do today that Portland is an absolutely wonderful ""town"".

We are a three-person family, with additional family members of Buttercup the cat, Polly the dog, and Tardis the fish.

We enjoy reading, gardening, bike rides, and travel! We love our neighborhood, our tight-knit community,  and our proximity to Mt. Tabor Park, which we visit often, but never often enough!

There are usually neighborhood kids in the front or back yard, but we value peace and quiet, so the kids are kept to a dull roar. ;-)

We think you will enjoy staying in the private studio, and wandering around the neighborhood to check our restaurants, parks, cafes, and Portland, in general. See you soon!

I've lived all over Portland, but once I landed in the Alberta Arts district that was it. Even in a city known for 'different', Alberta pushed the free- and forward-thinking envelope just a little bit further.

I've worn a lot of different hats over the years, but right now I'm drawn to the intersection where art, activism and the cooperative movement meet. I think the Alberta neighborhood is a great template where we might develop and model sustainable local urban living--I'd love to see food planted up and down the alleys, Alberta Street turned into a permanent walking/shopping boulevard.

Don't just take our word for it: Portland was the ONLY U.S. City to be voted in 2015 as one of the top 25 most livable cities around the world. 

While we just started hosting through Airbnb in May, we are so deeply touched and humbled by the amazing guests we've met so far and look forward to those of you we've yet to meet.  We absolutely love entertaining and sharing the many treasures of Portland and the great Pacific NW with others.  

As fairly seasoned travelers ourselves, we also know what makes for a great stay and are invested in providing that for YOU as our guests.  

Now that we're newly retired from being public servants for years, we have lots more time for our hobbies and travels. You'll often find us being ""groupies"" for The Rad Trads; our son's band. The Rad Trads play energetic standards and originals that blend New Orleans Jazz, Delta Blues and Rock and Roll.  My latest favorite is ""Vada Via"" that Alden wrote. Check out the YouTube video of them singing it at the London Blues Kitchen or one of their fun music videos: ""Keith Richards and I."" They play concerts and festivals all over the world and may even be near your city.   Who knows?!  One day you might be able to say ""I slept in the Portland Home of The Rad Trads!"" 

Portland's own musical treasures, The Norman Sylvester Band, keeps us dancing (we're teaching ourselves swing dance from youtube) to the blues around Portland.

Want to learn how to make wine?  Be a guest next Fall and go wine picking at a picture perfect u-pick farm; Z Farm-Hubbard. In September we picked over 1300 pounds of Pinot Noir grapes and always make it quite a party.  We've made wine for the last seven years.  Bob also makes some of the best beer around from our homegrown hops.

Enough about our adventures; here's to YOUR NEW ADVENTURES!

We love to travel! Most recently we went to London, Amsterdam and plan on going to Germany next.  Paul works for an airline, so we are always planning our next trip.  

We love homes!  We both watch quite a bit of HGTV and love looking at homes even if we aren't purchasing.  We enjoy making houses into homes.  We also believe in community and leveraging your biggest asset which is why we are on Airbnb.

We love family!  We live 5 blocks from where Paul grew up and where his parents still reside.  Our family is large and so we joke that we don't have many friends outside the family and those friends we do have outside blood relatives have been adopted into the family because we value it so deeply.

As Landlords:
We have rented to long term tenants for nearly 10 years.  We enjoy sharing our home, wherever that may be.  We have just started short term rentals, and are very excited because we get to wear our hospitality hat.  We hope that each of our guests feels as comfortable as any family or friend that stays with us.  We are aiming to try to introduce people to the area by providing a book of what to do, where to go, what to see, etc.  We also want to provide each guest with a unique experience, thus plan to give them samples of local goods while staying in our home.   We love history, so if and when possible we will also introduce our guests to the history of the area.

From our Posting:
We are a couple who takes pride in our home and neighborhood.  We treat our rental space as a business and will go out of our way to make your stay as comfortable as possible.  Due to our work schedules one of us is usually available most hours of the day and will make ourselves available if needed.  We will be living in the other unit of the home unless rented, and when rented will be only blocks away to assure the best possible stay. This space is truly your home away from home, and our goal is to welcome you as such by going the extra mile, so please don’t hesitate to ask any questions or vocalize any feedback you may have.  We ask you treat our home with the same care we do, please see our house rules.

My life is a creative, joyful and sometimes messy balancing act between parenting an amazing kid, designing spaces, places + instructional things, and filled with as much climbing (inside or out) as possible. 

Somewhere in the spaces between, I am also renovating my 100+ year old home - a sweet old girl with great bones - which was once dilapidated and on the verge of ruin. We've giving her some lovin' with the hopes she'll see another 100 years of life and living under her (new...and fully insulated!) roof. 

Life is an interesting journey - and we only get one. I am always amazed and grateful for the wonderful people that cross my path. Maybe the next will be you!

I  grew up in Romania, then lived in Paris, Santa Cruz and Oakland until I chose Portland as my home back in 2002 when it wasn't nearly as cool as it is nowadays.

My inspiration for hosting people comes from a few different sources. One is that when I grew up in Romania under a dictatorship, we were supposed to report to the police any guests we had in our home that were from outside the country. My parents hosted people we met while traveling anyway and it felt cool, subversive and somewhat dangerous.

The other inspiration is that while I lived and went to school in Paris in my 20s I met some of the most influential people in my life while hanging out at the famous bookstore Shakespeare & Co. 

George Whitman, had a decades long tradition of hosting artists, writers and other weary travelers in exchange for work in the bookstore and the story of their lives. 

I see Portland having a little bit of the Paris spirit that I enjoyed in my 20s.


I have a background in quantum physics but I spent the last 13 years running a software and ecommerce business.

We tried to feature local artists in the house in case you might feel inspired to buy some of it while you are in Portland.

We have become coffee and beer snobs in the last decade as our neighborhood has been filling up with wonderful small coffee roasters and breweries.

We love to explore the world, have done a lot of that independently and as a family - teaching our young daughter about different cultures and lifestyles is a passion of ours. We are loyal and respectful Air B&B users and also excited to list our own property here: our family home in NE  Portland has a separate one bedroom apartment on the bottom level for vacation rentals. 
A bit about me: I cannot begin to list my favorite foods and books, I feel like I eat and read way too much for that. We see live music as often as possible - my favorites: Jack White, Conor Oberst, M Ward. My husbands favorites: Grateful Dead, Phish, ALO. Our daughters favorites: Frozen. We proudly wave the Third Man flag (for me) and Phish flag (for him) outside our home and at some point you'll probably see our little one dressed like Elsa, carrying a tree branch and telling you to ""Freeze"".

I  have a dog called Tilly (after Tillamook Forest where I first took her camping) who is a mutt but mostly Australian Shepherd and Labrador.

I also love big city life with the bar and restaurant scenes and dancing to good electronic music.  I practice yoga, collect art and love to discuss politics and the state of this great nation.  Bill Maher is my favourite talk show host, John Oliver my favourite source of news ;) and I just love Shameless and Nurse Jackie. I watch movies regularly and read a lot.

I am lucky enough to work in the high tech industry down in the Bay Area so I get to travel down regularly and get my sun fixes during the mostly wet months from Oct to Jun in Portland.

No cleaning fee for this apartment (hurray!), so we do expect tenants to clean as they go and to take their shoes off when inside. If you have any questions please feel free to ask. Thank you for looking. 

Sorry street parking only, no pets, no smoking and no candles. Also we do not take reservations from third parties.

Here is a review I treasure left by an Airbnb Guest:

""While we wish we could have stayed forever, our time at Susan's was just super perfect. I'd like to state that Susan is an incredible character who exceeded our Host expectations and was so welcoming I thought I might actually be family. The place was private, neat and BEYOND charming; the kind that supersedes any trendy, minimalist loft and more so gives a cozy, staying-with-Auntie-over-the-summer-learning-to-paint-because-she's-a-lovely-artist-and-drinking-lemonade-everyday kind of vibe. It was genuine and felt almost nostalgic. Any how, we would just really like to publicly announce how much Susan's hospitality meant to us. We will be keeping Susan updated on our future travels to Portland. P.S.

She is currently section hiking the Pacific Crest Trail thru Oregon and has close to 325 miles tromped off.  Lori has hiked most of the Columbia Gorge trails and a majority of the hikes in and around Mt. Hood.  She would love to show you a map of the hiking areas with every hike highlighted that she tromped.

Lori is an administrator at the middle school level.  She is a recovering Physical Education/Health teacher of 13 years before moving up to administration.  She absolutely loves her job and is excited to wake up every day knowing she is doing exactly what she is suppose to do.

I invite you to stay and enjoy Portland and Oregon and all it has to offer.

She has lived here since 1949 and raised her children here with her husband Bill Mayther. She came from Duluth, Minnesota where her creative life was noted in a LIFE magazine spread when she was in college. She and Bill worked at the Linnton Community Center through the 60's and early 70's developing a nationally recognized arts program including employing many of Oregon's regional Artists like Ray Grimm, Kay Lee, Dan Stevens, Jerry Glenn, John Morrison, Tom and Michelle Earley, Dottie Fields, LaVerne Krause, Buzy Hughes so many more (if I missed you, call me and I'll add your name) 
In 1968, Betty was one of the founding principal team members who founded the Metropolitan Learning Center in NW Portland. This is an alternative free school for K-12 students in the Portland Public School system based on A.S. Neill's Summerhill where students engaged with all age groups, formed individual learning plans with parent and teacher guidance and were encouraged to find their own voice in a supportive and creative environment utilizing outside resources and other learning facilities and travel as part of the overall learning environment. The school has evolved over the years and still exists today.
After retiring from the school system, Betty received another Master degree from Pratt Institute in Art Therapy and went on to teach at PNCA, PSU, Lewis and Clark and many , many private workshops throughout the state as well as mentoring Art Therapy candidates from Marylhurst and PSU.

Betty loved to travel all over the world, meeting new people and sharing her ideas and expertise. From Mexico to India and all over the United States, she expanded her sphere world wide. She changed young lives, gave with a wide open heart and was, herself a gifted artist, exploring the inner and outer world with love and enthusiasm!

This cottage has been her studio, a home for her daughter Robin and her son William when he was little, a haven for young artists as their home and now a place where we welcome travelers from all over the world to help in paying for her care and the upkeep of her home. This home is on the historic registry as the Mayther-Coburn House in honor of her longstanding tenure and stewardship.

We thank you for considering staying with us and if you do, we hope you enjoy the little bit of history provided here!
Happy travels!

Ben: Explorer, enthusiast and engineer at large. I used to utilize couchsurfing for my first steps of meeting and getting introduced to people and place, and have from that established myself a nice network of friends and family here in the US. 
I seem to have embarked pretty heavily on a career in research and academia, hence my days are quite defined by that, and exploring the wild, both outdoors and indoors (concerts, venues, restaurants, etc.) with my lovely better half. 
If not that, then I enjoy a good run, ski-trip, a good newspaper and a good read, certainly some really terrible action movies. 

Jamie: 
Is also pretty great, by being a very seasoned world-traveller, French teacher and entrepreneur and house plant extraordinaire. And so many other things she will only tell you when you are staying here.

8638508,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/8638508,Tiffany,2013-09-04,"My love affair began in 1998. After traveling 27 states in 7 months, I knew I had found home as soon as I arrived in Portland, Oregon. It was fall and the leaves were crisp with color. That winter the snow covered the streets and I walked down the center of Broadway from my studio in the city. When spring arrived the cherry trees on the waterfront blossomed and filled the air with a fragrance I still look forward to annually. And then, summer arrived with its bounty and I was more than smitten. I could hike a mountain, float a river, raft rapids, bike wine country, climb a rock and still be home in time to get my heels on, catch a Broadway show and eat like royalty.

Since then, I have grown up enjoying all of that year round and sharing it with others. I have worked with some of the best dinner houses and wineries Oregon has to offer as a server, sommelier and event coordinator. Whenever guests asked me what else they should do on their visit I love writing up lists of places to visit, hikes to go on and how they can get on our rivers & take in a live performance. 

When I travel other cities my favorite thing to do is walk or bike them.  Many times with a vague idea of where I eventually wanted to end up, but always enjoying the journey of getting there with equal enthusiasm. My favorite day in Paris I spent walking, from Jardin du Luxemberg (where I drank a beer while watching a very serious bout of petanque) through neighborhoods of broken sidewalk uphill to Le Sacre Coure (where I ate cheese and chacuterie on the grass steps) down passed the carousel of Montmarte and down the hill to my apartment with a balcony where I sipped coffee as the sun rose and the bells of Eglise de la Trinite tolled.

In my former life I worked as a counselor in addictions and in retail sales at clothing boutiques.  I love clothes and shoes  :)
I have lived in Portland for 22 years and enjoy the outdoor activities the city and surrounding area offers. It is still a small town feel with lots to see and do. My computer tech b/f Ken and kitty Daisy share the home with me. 
I grew up in Woodland Hills, CA in a large Irish Catholic family. 
Interesting tidbits about me: I am best friends with my ex-husband and have had numerous interactions with celebrities. Katherine Ross and Michael J Fox to name a few. 
I am an avid fan of exercise i.e. hiking, walking, kayaking, gym workouts, tennis and golf. I love to read, solve crosswords and drink fabulous Oregon Pinot Noirs. 
I'm open and easy going; just glad to have you come and stay.

Thanks for having a look and considering staying in my home.

I'm so lucky to have a home in an amazing area of Portland and look forward to sharing this place with guests. I personally think this is the ideal neighborhood for many reasons, including proximity: I'm a short walk from Alberta Arts, 15 minute bike ride to downtown, 15 minute bike ride to SE Hawthorne area, and a 10 minute drive to the airport. 

A few tips: Dalos Ethiopian restaurant is 15 blocks away and perhaps the best inexpensive meal in all of Portland. Try the burger at Grain & Gristle across the street. Take a walk to the Sabin Community Garden. Go see a movie at the Kennedy School. Get a piece of pie at Random Order.

We race bicycles, cross train in any way we can including kayaking, skiing, riking (a combo run/hike sport we created because hiking was just too slow much to the chagrin of our kids!). Kara is a photographer and also paints, makes jewelry and can't wait to get a pottery wheel someday. She supports local artists any way she can and is an avid collector of modern and vintage artwork.

Who I am is not easy to define within a few paragraphs. Let's see what I can come up with.  

I'm a first generation French lady then a New Yorker who has relocated to Portland, Oregon. GO YANKEES!! I love a healthy rivalry and recognize all teams talent. 

I'm an optimistic, my cup is always overflowing and I believe we must surround ourselves with positive energy and uplifting spirits. I do not like the words perfect or normal, they should be removed from all languages. 

I recognize challenges as opportunity for growth and know that our perspective and approaches makes the greatest differences. 

I own a thriving company, love water sports, snowboarding/skiing, rock climbing, traveling, dinner parties, wine and in general people. I have recently returned back to school to obtain my J.D. degree in business and malpractice law. 

My life's moto is: 
'Give without expecting a return, be honest despite circumstances and love without reserve. Take chances but never be foolish, believe in all but be aware. Keep your chin up and head high. Our greatest challenges are battling the we inside.' -- Véronique LaFont 

I look forward to meeting our next guests. 

à votre santé,

We love to create and to make memories.  As we travel for work we thought what better way to help others make memories in Portland than to share our home.  Robbie is a Footwear Design Director and I am a Florist, Graphic Designer, Materials Rep for textiles, and a stay at home mom of two sweet kids. Max (4yrs) and Maddie (1yr).    

We travel most often for business but love the occasional vacation with family as the schedule allows :) Our space is a successful blend of midcentury and modern.  It's warm, efficient, and set up for those who love to cook and enjoy the outdoors.  We live in the forest AND in the city, so if you like the comforts of a hotel or the wild outdoors we have you covered. A trail to forest park starts less than 500 yards from our front door and we are literally 5 min from  downtown Portland, just coast down the hill.

To sum us up, we love Jesus, family, design, movies, community, great food and drink, and the words that best describe us are peaceful, flexible, and motivated :)  Look forward to seeing you soon.

We love and embrace innovation and contemporary thinking as it fuels our hobbies.  We love cycling, travel, dancing, fly fishing and most of all real jazz, classical and R&B music to name just a few.  We look forward to meeting new folks through the Airbnb experience as hosts and guests.  

5 things we can't live without?  Family, friends, peace, love and each other!  Favorite destination?  Savannah, Georgia.  Favorite music? Earth Wind and Fire, Take 6. Bruno Mars, Cannonball Adderley and the Portland Symphony.

A little about myself.  I am an avid traveler when work doesn't get in the way. I would define a successful trip as one where I was able to, if only for a moment, dissolve into another culture and feel as I was apart of a place that is not my own.  This feeling drives my sense of place and understanding of the big blue marble we all share. But enough of the philosophical me.  One of my passions is cooking and my international travels are often driven by my desire to go to great food cultures.  

I am a Landscape Architect by training, so I always weave interesting expressions in the built environment into my food driven itinerary.

My heritage is Irish and I am currently reading Oscar Wilde in honor of my next excursion, which is Dublin.

As for Travel, I appreciate the great wonders and attractions of the world, but my happiness lies in a small cafe or bar and in the side streets of the cities I visit.  I do strive to experience the culture of a place. I look forward to sharing an cocktail and your city!

Ryan

I am new to Airbnb. I have friends that use the service, and they recommended it to me.

I'm a 32 y.o. lady from Portland, OR, but currently am staying in rural Illinois. I'm looking for a place to stay in Chicago from April 7th - May 7th (or somewhere around those dates). I have a super awesome, well-mannered black lab with me. He's 10ish years old and medium in size. We are a package deal. 

I'm a very clean, responsible, and respectful person. I will take good care of your place! I can provide a rental reference from the homeowner I currently rent from in Portland. I've lived peacefully with about a gazillion different people over the years, so if you have a roommate I'm sure we will be able to get along fine. I have a lot of online classes this semester, so I will mostly just be sitting around the apartment doing computer work. 

If you are interested in some more personal details:
I'm a full time student at Portland State University, studying Public Health and Community Development. I work as a massage therapist. In my free time 
I love to garden, travel, learn, camp, bike, cook, and hang with my dog pal.

For the moment it's just me (Carlos) and the panter (Sola), but you will see a lot of Ines in the old tomes, embracing nooks, and thoughtful wanderlust that defines the space.

I am content cave painting for long stretches but I come out when for the farther side of culture that courses through town. I have my haunts and events, and I've lived here long enough that I can recommend something for everyone. I am around, so if it's clear out there may be fire and whiskey, and if I am headed out somewhere there's a good chance you're invited. That place might be the Doug Fir (best small music venue), Helium (best comedy club), or Church of Film (best never-ending film festival) for example.

Sola, for her part, enjoys copious, unbroken attention and long walks on the planet. She is very friendly but-- and don't repeat this-- she can be kind of narcissistic and contrarian at times. You know, more of a talker than a listener. That said, she is one of my favorite people and the only person I know who sheds more than I do.

I am an architect who has lived in Portland for 25 years. I love this city and have enjoyed seeing it grow into the creative destination it is known for today. There is a sense of community here that is fostered by all of the small local businesses and restaurants. The best way to experience the city is to walk the small commercial districts and my house is in the center of several. I'm also the mother of two wonderful teen boys and share my large house with a very quiet roommate. Besides architecture my interests include cooking, gardening, reading, and exploring the beautiful landscapes of the Pacific Northwest.
