I've started two companies and worked in retail, electronics distribution, mining, cable, and consumer packaged goods. I'm finishing up my second Masters at DU currently, so that keeps me busy and I am working on growing my outdoor apparel line called Tamagear. I also have an 11 month old Bernese Mountain Dog who is fantastic. I like to travel when possible. My favorite places are San Diego, Denver, Cancun and Europe.

I moved to Denver with the intent on staying somewhere longer than a few months and I'm very happy to be here :) So now that I have an apartment, a bed and a couch, I've decided to list my place on Airbnb. I want to give other travelers the opportunity to stay in a comfortable, conveniently located place, but without the cost of traditional hotels.

Most people won't know this, but in order to get your law license, you have to pass a Character and Fitness test, which I have meaning that I passed my FBI background check. (SEE ABOVE IF CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY).

I myself love to travel. I've been across most of Europe and to Morocco. Feel free to share your travel tips and little known  locations with me, I would totally appreciate it. It may be a while before I have to funds to get out again, but I'm always adding to my location or experience wish list.

At home, I like to rock climb, go rafting, and pretty much any adventure Colorado has to offer. So anyone who needs another body for an adventure, count me in! I'm also a bit of a nerd who likes puzzles, reading, playing board games with friends. I'm currently learning to knit. My friends and I also like to try out local breweries on occasion. 

When I'm not traveling or working a ton, I can be a bit of a homebody. My current roommate is moving out and since my last 3 roommates have taken the isolation approach, I thought it might be nice to have various people coming through so that on occasion, I might have guests who want to chat or go on an adventure. Of course, I completely understand the need and desire for privacy so just let me know ahead of time what kind of trip/experience you're looking for.

Additionally, I am currently job hunting, therefore I have more time to dedicate to my guests if they would like me to take them out or just provide transportation.

We love the Colorado lifestyle and find Denver pretty perfect for doing what we like to do. It's always a pleasure to meet new people who have things to say or things to teach, and we always feel honored to make new friends. We are constantly learning and challenging each other to grow. Art is a passion for Claire and music is a part-time job for Bryant and, as a result, we have created a very beautiful and creative environment that we live in. All this being said, when time and circumstance permit, we definitely like a good dance party with some live or electronic music and have been known to have some epically hedonistic party-time.

The location is peaceful and secure. A pretty, classic, and private home that is the perfect combination of being just far away enough from the hustle and bustle to have a quiet neighborhood feel, yet close enough to be in a fun vibrant area. 

The private garden is a little sanctuary in the city, secure, relaxing, and pleasant. 

And having a garage is very convenient, it makes parking a breeze.

Please let us know if we can help with any questions or special needs.

I want to show him the world and I am glad to have found Airbnb as it seems like a great way to meet life long friends and visit amazing places. I am a French teacher at an international school in Denver (My son attends the same school.) So that goes without saying that I only speak French with my son! ;-)
5 things I can't live without?
Travelling and learning about other cultures
Swimming
Watching movies
Mexican food
Spending time with my family
And music! (OK, 6 things.)
I have used Airbnb twice- once hosting and once travelling in Belgium. Both were not the greatest experiences but I am ready to give it another try this summer. I am extremely tidy (maybe a little OCD) so you can be sure that we will leave your place as we found it. :-)
One of the quotes I really like is, "" Ne laisse jamais quelqu'un devenir une priorité dans ta vie alors que tu n'es pas qu'une option dans la sienne.""

Home projects take up much of my time, and I may be a bit obsessed with all things photography. I spend much of my time in Kailua, Hawaii (work and play) and am thankful - even for the crazy schedule it creates. Surfing will get easier for me any day now, I'm sure.

Platt Park became my home summer of 2015, so I'm still settling in, and I absolutely love it! Local Favs: Sushi Den (dinner), Stellas (coffee), The Colorado Store (souvenirs), Kindness (yoga), Pajama Baking Co. (ice cream & baguettes), Platt Park Brewery (dog/kid friendly and sample flights are fun), and Kaos Pizza (pizza & happy hour).

When I'm not doing that...I enjoy curling up by the fire, blogging, relaxing with a swing project, watching the snow fall, sun rise, or spying the birds fluttering by. 

It's a good life.

I spent years in the hospitality industry primarily running the food and beverage operations.  After about a decade I moved on to entrepreneurial work.

I'm a native to Colorado and my hobbies reflect that.  I love to ski, snowboard, hike, camp, go out dancing, play volleyball, and I'm down for pretty much anything because fun can be had anywhere.

I love to travel and have been to Central America, South America, a number of Caribbean locations, Africa, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.

If I'm ever staying at your place you can count on me to be chill and easy going.  I love adventure so if you have ideas of places for me to check out, or events for me to participate in my ears are wide open.  I dig five star resorts and crowded hostels alike.  But what's most important to me is to be with locals and learn what they do, what they like, and how they live.

If you're ever staying at my place you can generally just shoot me a text and I'm never too far away to answer questions.  Also, if you're looking for any fun in the area just let me know and I'm happy to recommend cool places to check out, great restaurants and bars, and various seasonal events going on. 

Being in the hospitality industry for so long makes me kind of obsessed with service and ensuring you have what you need.  I'm happy to provide arrival amenities for you as well - in case it's a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary - just let me know and we can chat about what you're looking for and if there is an additional price for it.",within an hour,100,100%,f,https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/10109001/profile_pic/1405548519/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/10109001/profile_pic/1405548519/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,North Capitol Hill,1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'kba']",t,t,1,Denver, Colorado, United States

I love my Denver bungalow in the middle of the city.  You can easily walk to so many great places from here and quickly bike to even more. I'm happy to tell you the best places to go in the neighborhood (and there are a lot of great places to go in this area!). I'd love to have a cup of tea or glass of wine with you (time and schedules permitting). 

I'm a writer and artist, as well as a sustainable interior designer.
People are awesome, so are cities, animals, hot springs and nature. Can't live without great stories. I love NYC (lived there for a decade), Kathmandu, Seagrove Beach, Bangkok, and even LA --actually Santa Monica-- where I lived for a while as a kid. I've lived all over US and a few places in Europe and the East incl. Nepal for a semester where I studied religion.

Favorite books? Pride and Prejudice, Manchurian Candidate, almost anything by Carl Hiaasen (my most favorite character ever is Skink), Harry Potter and various juvie books. I usually only read authors with a great sense of humor anymore (this includes the ones above).

I haven't traveled out of country lately: trips to Southern California and to local hot springs this summer saved my soul.

I love all sorts of movies, incl. juvie movies. I make wine, drink a couple times a week, sometimes eat gluten free, sugar free and so on, but love food and sometimes eat anything. I'm an omnivore for now at least.
I enjoy a respectful, relaxed, friendly home situation.

Although my preference and pleasure is to check you in myself and give you the grand tour, there are naturally times when I'm not not able to be here.

My job is great, and I am able to work with people from all over the world, and fortunate enough to play music for a living. When I am not working in music and radio I like to be outside. I moved to Colorado in 2003 to take advantage of the mountains, and skiing, backpacking and hiking are my main outdoor interests. Colorado is a wonderful state to visit if you enjoy the outdoors, and is part of the reason I have lived here over the last decade. 

Denver is a great city, and really starting to come into it's own. When I first moved to the city, I felt it had pretty weak restaurants and food in general, but that has changed dramatically in the last few years. There are now a plethora of restaurants and little food shops, and while the craft breweries have always been in Denver, there are now over 100 in the Denver metro area. I've always been kind of a beer nerd, and that is a nice plus to living here. The governor, in fact, is a former brewery owner. 

As a host, I try to make my condo feel like a place in which I would want to stay. It will always be nice and clean with plenty of space. You should feel more than comfortable when staying in my home.

Have traveled quite a bit myself both in the USA and overseas (South and Central America, Japan, Germany, UK, Italy, Czech Republic, Canada). I also enjoy a BnB type experience when I travel, or very small locally owned pensions, hotels. What's the point of traveling if you are not going to get to know the people who live there?

My dual careers keep me quite busy, so altho I will definitely want to meet you and have some conversation, I also respect personal space. I like to cook and would be happy to share some meals based in our mutual availability. I'm new to Air BnB but for the past 3 years I have rented my extra bedrooms on a month-month basis mostly to folks who were in the relocation process or here in Denver for temporary work, so I am very used to sharing my space and really enjoy doing so. I have a small non shedding dander free dog, Isabella who is a total Mommie's girl, but friendly once she knows you.

I absolutely love this neighborhood and can recommend the best places to eat, grab coffee, shop, get your nails done, etc... I love the Art Gallery scene, have lots of friends here who are professional artists and can show you around spots that the guides won't tell you about where it comes to Visual Arts (even some private studio visits with some of my art making friends if you like).

I love foreign and indie films and we've got a great little theatre right up the street (The Esquire) and the Mayan is also very close. 

Kind of a health nut, I am not much of a drinker anymore but an occasional glass of wine is fine. 420 friendly here, altho I no longer indulge myself. I enjoy meeting folks of all ages but will mention that I need quiet after 10:00 pm weeknights. I have a 30+ year Buddhist practice so I meditate every morning and a bit in the evening too, but you don't need to tiptoe around me or anything... I have a private space in my own room for chanting and meditation. 

I guess if I have a life motto its ""live live live"". See the world, meet its people, be kind to others and smile and they will be kind to you.

After a life time in Iowa and 33 years in our home, we packed up and moved to Denver.  We rented a home for a few months and then bought this charming bungalow in NW Denver. One of our daughters and her family moved at the same time we did as she took a position with Visit Estes in Estes Park, CO.  We now have 4 grand children in the vicinity, two only two blocks away.  Our house is therefore kid proof and comes with a play room.  We have stayed in airbnb homes and apartments many times and found it our preferred way to vacation.  It always gives us a change to experience what it would be like to live in different places and spaces.  We would like to offer our home for others who are looking for a more affordable way to travel. Our home will easily accommodate families or several couples who are traveling together.  It would be spacious enough for family get togethers.   We like the personal experience and the connection with neighborhoods.  We love the local restaurants and bars, the little shops, and the people we have experienced here. We like good literature, art, learning, hiking, and all the out of doors we can fit into one day (especially my husband) . We also spend a lot of time in NYC and San Diego the cities where our other two children live and would love to trade homes with you if you are in those cities. We will be happy to help you in anyway to make your travel smooth and enjoyable.  See you soon.

We love to travel all over the world, explore new places, and get to know the people who are from those places so we can get an inside look instead of just a tourists view.  While traveling, we do like to make the most of our time and tend to be on the go quite a bit, so our resting place usually is just used for sleep, showers/getting ready, and to hold our things.  We would like to welcome you into our home in Denver as well so we can share travel stories, and give you tips on what to do in our amazing city and state!

I have a traveling soul and love any opportunity to visit new places whether it's nationally or abroad. I am originally from Las Vegas, NV where I worked as a night auditor, conceirege and bartender while going to college. After graduation, I moved to Austin, TX to get my first big girl job, eat as much BBQ as possible and play roller derby. During my six years down south I made a lot of wonderful friends. I have since moved to Denver and love the cool weather and hospitality. Denver has beautiful mountains, a booming city and a warm community. I have always been a firm believer that the connections you make while traveling to new places can make or break a trip. I look forward to meeting some new faces, exchanging stories and hosting in the lovely Denver, CO.

I bought a house on the still raw edge of the downtown area, began renovating and restoring, and the following year I started my gardening business...
After hours I play piano, paint, train my pup, tend to my own garden.
I love spring, beginning again, anew. In the summertime, its watermelon, fruit, the sun-swept garden. In winter, I am drawn to the ocean and the seashore and the spanish speaking world...

The egress window makes it light and the ceilings are not low.  We love the area.  It has a fabulous bathroom with a large soaker tub, a walk-in shower and the laundry is on your floor as well.  A lovely self contained area. If you are allergic to cats or don't like them, our home is not for you.  They have the run of the house and we love them dearly.

Denver is an incredible place to live and I adore it.  I have been here, in this house for 27 years.  Wash Park is one of Denver's premier parks with walking/biking paths, tennis courts, a lake and much more.  It is about 8 blocks long and 4 blocks wide and I am 1/2 block away from it. 

I am a social person who loves to be with my friends playing tennis, eating out or just entertaining.  I have a 19 year old daughter who is a freshman in college.  I have great friends and am really close to my family immediate and extended.  I love to travel and have participated in many home exchanges around the world.  I am self-employed as a CPA.  We have 3 cats which we love dearly who are friendly and fun.  I love tennis, music, cooking, eating out and travel.  I love to garden and if we are not travelling extensively during the summer, I usually have a kitchen garden going in the back yard.  We have a lovely patio in the back with a table, a seating area and a grill.  The space is covered for the rare rain we get and to keep the space cool in the summer.

You can walk to either S. Gaylord or S. Pearl and there are retail stores, bars and restaurants.  Lite Rail will get you from the airport to within walking distance of our house.  It then can take you downtown, to all of the sports and entertainment arenas, Park Meadows Mall and other places.   You could do without a car from our house and do just fine unless you want to head to the mountain towns.

I am an active person who is constantly curious.  I am an amateur photographer.  I travel quite a bit.  Because we are new to this and I have a young daughter, I would prefer couples and women guests.

Sloan and I think it's weird when people call it ColoRADical, but find Denver to be pretty great. Sloan was born and raised (while touring with his band, Single File, for many years, and making home and career [Video Game Design] in NC and Los Angeles-- eventually settling back in Denver). Sloan now works in engineering design and dabbles in contracting, he's a telecommuter for a company in LA. I'm from Huntsville, Alabama and totally lost my accent (so people say), but still support use of the word y'all. I moved to Denver for a job in 2013; I work at a college as the liaison to our high school population, so I'm kind of the college-mom to 700 teenagers at any time; so I enjoy my PTO and use it wisely.  I really enjoy Colorado; the skiing is amazing, the views are kinda silly how awesome, and there's always a reason to eat (my number one). 

I (Amber) love roller-coasters and am constantly bugging Sloan to vacation to anywhere that has them. We think Airbnb is way cooler than hotels, unless the hotels have free happy hour… then... #sorry

Anyways, as far as hosting goes… we bought our house in April 2015; Sloan immediately started tearing down walls (lit-er-ally), he's kind of amazing at design (ifIdosaysomyself) and we've ended up with a house that (IMO) stands out from the rest. We adore -I don't use super fancy words lightly- our home. We really wanted to stay away from the modern, sleek, new-age feel that is popping up everywhere, so we kept all the old features and did lots of re-purposing! Most of our decor has a story and/or we found it at a estate sale.

Here's my background: raised in Norway (with mom and sister) and then came to the New York to live with my father and go to High School.  After High School I ended up at University of Connecticut.  The plan was to head back to Norway but alas, I left for California for about a decade.  Five years ago I made the brilliant life decision of moving to Colorado.  The people, the weather, the golf, the overall beauty of this state make me eternally grateful.  Now that I finally have bought an amazing home I am so happy to share it with out-of-state visitors to give you that extra bit of comfort and convenience during your stay in Colorado. If only Airbnb was around all those years I was traveling around!  I can guarantee  you an exceptional stay at my home and urge you to contact me if you need anything at all when you are in my home.  I believe in always treating people the way I want to be treated and I walk around in a perpetual state of gratitude and feeling empathetic.

(NOTE: A house is just a place to sleep, a HOME is made up of the people in it)

My name is Spencer and I am happy that you have taken an interest in my listing.  Things are always changing and being updated around here, so it is only going to get better! I bought the house in October of 2014, and have been working on it ever since (i.e., bathroom updates, custoom privacy fence, newly constructed pergola, addition of a ""mud-room"", lighting and painting...the list goes on and doesnt seem to stop!).

I am originally from the south and moved here in 2009.  I graduated from Colorado State University and currently am seeking a graduate degree (part-time).  I work for the U.S. Department of the Interior here in Denver, CO. (Often from home) For those of you who are pet lovers, I just recently welcomed ""Lady Emmaline"" to my home.  Emma is a Goldendoodle, hypoalergenic, no-shedding, and loves to LOVE.  I should charge more because she is so damn cute! ;).  

I enjoy ALL outdoors.  I am an avid skier, fisherman, hiker, and rock climber.  I also enjoy sipping the astonishing amount of craft beers Denver has to offer.  

I dont find it easy to talk about myself, so please, ask me any questions you may have.  I can tell you what you can expect from me as your host: 
1.  A clean home for your stay;
2.  Safe and comfortable accomadations;
3.  Full access to the the kitchen, living room, your own private bedroom and bathroom as well as outdoor areas (BBQ, Pergola, hammock, fire pit)
4.  Off-street parking (No meters or parking tickets here);

Laughing Latte also at 32nd and Tejon makes a mean cup of Joe.  Little Man Ice Cream is just across Hershorn Park - you can see the milk can building from the front porch.

I was born and raised in Buffalo, New York; went to high school and college in Arkansas; and spent the last 18 years living in Denver, Colorado.

I'm currently living on the island of Roatan, which is 35 miles off the coast of Honduras. It's surrounded by coral reef and the Caribbean Sea.

I use AirBnB to manage a rental property here, located in Sandy Bay on the north side of the island. It has a large studio apartment on the first floor where I live, and the two plus bedroom rental house on the second and third floors. It's a little slice of palm-tree-fringed heaven right on the beach!

While I'm in Honduras, I'm renting out my home in Denver, CO. When I don't have long-term renters in it, I rent it out short-term on AirBnB.

I am a freelance Divemaster. I also run a kayak/SUP/GoPro rental business on the side called Sandy Bay Paddle. Guests at my properties get discounts on rental equipment.

If you're an animal lover coming to Roatan, we always need pet meds of all kinds! Flea, tick, mange, worm and heart worm medicines are most needed, but we'll take anything and in any quantity! Meds can be left at the Denver property too. We sterilize and feed feral cats in the neighborhood and can transport dog meds to the island on our return trips.

A former serial entrepreneur, Patrick once started businesses he thought would earn him enough money to live a life full of meaning and difference making. He was always searching for the means to an end. It wasn't until yoga teacher training in 2001 that he found a way to combine his love of business with an end in itself.
 
14 years later, Patrick is the founder-owner of Kindness Yoga, a donation-based collection of studios that hosts scores of teachers and tens of thousands of yoga students annually.
 
Patrick is the father of two girls and a husband. His life has taken on more and more meaning through his committed explorations into his own patterns of - and addictions to - suffering. His classes reflect this intimate and vulnerable process, and allow his students and fellow teachers to relate on a level that transforms. It is though his own healing journey and movement towards living his dharma that leads his yoga teaching, parenting, relationships and business.
 
Patrick has taught before tens of thousands of students, lead teacher trainings and mentored teachers over many years as the owner of Kindness Yoga. “We - as yoga studios and teachers - are not in competition with each other,"" he says. “Rather, we are in competition with all the unconscious activities out there.""

Mike and I are relatively new to AirBnB, but have lots of friends who are both hosts, and who stay as guests, and have only heard really great things about their experiences.  We hope to be hosts some day, but for now, we look forward to being guests.  I have two tween/teen sons, and we have three pups.  We are long time residents of Denver, and have loved watching the evolution of our City over the last several decades and continue to delight in exploring new and old in Denver.  We are avid cyclists (especially Mike, who logs over 10,000 miles/year on the roads and in the mountains, and is now getting back into cycle cross in his 60s!). I love to garden (very much in training!).  Most of our recreating is outside--hiking, camping, backpacking, skiing/riding, music festivals....and we also spend a fair bit of time exploring the art scene where ever we find ourselves, and often visit family and travel with family (upcoming family bike/packing trips to Moab and Machu Piccu).  We love to travel and are forever dreaming up our next adventure-currently dreaming of another backpack trip on Kaui's Kalalau trail to celebrate Valissa's 50th.  When on the road, we gravitate to exploring both relatively untamed wilderness and nitty gritty urban landscapes.  My boys attend an Expeditionary Learning school that takes them regularly on week-long camping adventures in the Western US, and can set a camp site like no one's business and are adventurous and undaunted travelers.  I have had a blast teaching them about how they'll likely travel some day when not with me--showing them youth hostels (they loved their first stay with me at a youth hostel in Charleston!), teaching them the common sense needed to enjoy the road.  We have made several visits to Greece and Guatemala to visit family, and closer to home had wonderful adventures in Zion, Bryce, Grand Canyon, Arches, and can't wait to see more of the National Parks. We dream of a family gap year where we can get more deeply rooted in a few locations.  Mike and I sneak away every now and then, just the two of us, and we just had an amazing several days along Big Sur. We are adventurous travelers and diners, and love to meet new people--very much casual folks, but can clean up pretty well when the occasion arises.  Life's motto--mine...Love Never Fails.  Mike--Miles and Smiles.  My younger son is a bit of a Buddha child who sees all that is good in the world, my older son is a quick-witted hipster in training, who loves soccer and fixies.

I love to dance, see a great concert and entertain at home. I am buying a travel camper and remodeling it for travel and minimalist living. 

I would like to travel more this year and plan on attending a perma-culture program in Costa Rica in March and learn to surf. Pura Vida! 

I currently divide time between Florida and Denver where I am remodeling a house that I hope to share soon on this site. My dream is to have a homes in several places and to share them with others while I travel the world and share wonderful times with my family and friends. 

I want to learn new things, meet new people and enjoy new experiences. 

This life is short... 

Cheers!

We're from Colorado, where we love outdoor activities and beauty in the mountains, music, nightlife and funky people watching.  We're both attorneys, though I am not currently practicing. Instead, I spend much of my time on environmental activism. Our children have all flown the coup. I spend most of my time in Glenwood Springs these days.

We love to travel locally and abroad. We do a lot of nature-focussed travel and backpacking but love to mix it up with a little luxury. I also love to experience different cultures - both US and foreign. Some of our favorite travels have been Dominica (the ""nature island""), Viet Nam and Cambodia, rafting in Dinosaur National Monument, backpacking in Colorado and Montana.  I lived in Ecuador for 7 years so speak Spanish.

I am now (August 2013) putting our condo in Glenwood Springs up for rent. We will happily rent you anything from a bedroom with private bath to the 2 BR/2 1/2 BA main floors to a basement/ BA suite, to the whole deal.

I also love to kayak on a tranquil lake to white water rafting on a great running river.  Love to play cards, too!
I am a large breed older dog rescuer (not me, ha!, the dogs I rescue)!  Puppies will always find a home but the older large dogs who have lost their homes need a gentle and loyal friend to give them the best quality  of life while they finish aging.
I love my profession, too!  As a professional Realtor and Broker, I've had the joy of helping hundreds of people  find their ""perfect"" home!  Also, it is a career that allows me to take some time to travel and get to know other wonderful places to live.  
I was raised in New Jersey but moved to Newport Beach, CA when I was 24.
Then I moved to Bellevue, WA., for 10 years!  After that, I wanted lots of sunshine and moved to Tucson, AZ.  All are  very different lifestyles and weather and I enjoyed each of them during the years I lived there. I have lived in Denver, CO., for the last 23 years and have watched it grow!!
Five things I can't live without are lazy beach days, whimsical days in the mountains and lakes, my grandchildren's ""I love you, Gramma""'s, dogs and chocolate!

I travel light and prefer bicycles - and tend to do a lot of work travel.

Living in one of the countries most beautiful states, I take advantage of my back yard by hiking, camping and snow shoeing.
